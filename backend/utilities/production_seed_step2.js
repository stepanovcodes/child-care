He comes home excited to tell me about all of the new things he has learned. We have not found a daycare that is quite like this one. Apart from that the level of cleanliness is amazing. I am grateful for the staff at this daycare, its a great feeling to be able to leave my kid with them while I work and not worry about him there.",

My Son has been going there since he was 1 years old and now 20 Months and I was so nervous in the beginning when you have to go back to work, but each person has made me feel like they treat my Son like their own. I can text call anytime to find out how he’s doing! What a warm, welcoming and caring Daycare. Could not be happier.\nHe will be there for many more years to come! Thank you Sammi for running a wonderful atmosphere. And Anoop is amazing!!!",

He has issues with eating and choking quite often and everyone who takes care of him is aware of his situation and thank God to this day we have never had an issue with him choking at daycare because he needs to be supervised while he eats and clearly is watched carefully and attentively.\n\nWe live in Auburn Bay and have day homes within walking distance and other daycare but the drive is completely worth it because I know when I leave him there he is being well cared for and I can go to work without worries at all. He is learning so much with all the teachers and his vocabulary is getting better and better.\n\nThe cleanliness and precautions they have taken with COVID still give me peace of mind when I drop him off and as we all adjust and learning how to improve and be more cautious so are they and im incredibly grateful.\n\nI would recommend them to anyone and everyone!",

I love the buildings and the space they've come up with. The teachers are so caring and great with the kids. The buildings are kept extra clean and are very bright and welcoming. It will be a sad day for us, when we no longer require Child Care, as Active Start has been a major part of our family.",

        "text": "3 of my kids went Al Amal, frankly my kids loved their teacher and enjoyed their preschool time. I read other people's review and I totally disagree with their oponion, and experiences but i highly respect them. I tried to breakdown most negative reviews I hope this might help future parents questions. One of the review says that teachers do not greeting their students? Well they do everyday! Secondly preschool has no outside area, so it is not safe for letting kids out alone as teachers cannot patrolize each kids thus they need to be indoor. They have sometimes breaks, not all the time, but I do not mind if their teacher do not give break because we got lot of Stat holidays, kids get sick missing their schools or for parent's reason we skip kid's school day etc. I hope you get my point here, so they need to follow up their cirriculum. But also its all about kids learning process which most family have no time out of school time. Another thing is that why should we so worry about snack if they give little vegi? All I consider is what my kids learning in his school. Is not that the best vitamin is education? So let them enjoy their moment. Frankly, if your kids has no happiness in this school go dive into it, learn the reason, but sometimes kids are too shy and/or not too social. These are characteric of being human, we cannot expect their teachers to break that ice. The school has some events or cookie days, helping other people in Ramadan these are great opportunities for kids to involve. It just time processing of growing we cannot expect change everything in miracle. I fell that after taking my 3 kids to Al Amal in different years, I should show my thankness to all teachers this way and help parents to make their decision in their way. Thank you Al Amal. Assalamun alaykum.",

I have the following suggestions for the staff:\n\n1- Assign a happy smiling person to greet kids and parents when they arrive. Miss Hiba used to be better than other staff in greeting. Kids need to be welcomed and get the energy when they arrive. This is very important, Miss Renata.\n2- They need to be more careful if a kid does something wrong. The staff needs to be trained on how to react against kids behavior.\n3- There were a couple of times our kid was injured in the school. Although it was OK and it may happen, but we were never told what happened! Our kid explained to us and it seems the staff were aware of the injury and they even used band aid for our kid. The staff must inform families if something happens even if it is not serious.",

My child was not happy there and was unable to see the light of day throughout his time there.\n\nThey never allowed the children outside breaks and was a very regimented schedule....more like a military school than a preschool. When I enquired as to why they are not allowed outside playtime the answer I received from the owner/operater was \"the kids aren't here for fun, they are here to study\". Last I checked, that's what Universities are for.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this preschool for parents that just want a loving, caring, child friendly environment....it is more for parents that want to put their kids through boot camp.\n\nAs well, the cancellation policy is just a mish mash of fine print that allows the owner to capitalize on keeping extra money and recieving extra funding through government subsidies.\n\nThis is basically an Islamic Preschool with Un-Islamic policies and procedures.",

This meant an inconvenient trip to a bank every month coupled with frequent follow ups by the lady, who received my child in the morning, on whether we had paid. That only stopped after told I her to make more effort to coordinate communication with the administrator. We were later provided with the option for transfer upon insistence.\n\nThe experience with the director (Jacklyn) in addressing why my child was returning home with torn clothe was appalling. After several follow ups in trying to find out why the cause of the rips, I once got a beyond inane suggestion of coming to visit the facility to see myself. I was quick to point out that visiting the facility and not finding anything  does not change the fact that the something within the facility was responsible for causing the damage. Beyond the rip to clothing was the bigger concern of the possibility that my child was being exposed to something so unsafe to cause the rip. Meeting with Jacklyn in person to address it was the peak as she showed an absolute lack of concern, which bordered on being racist. As you can imagine, that was our last day there.\n\nIf you cannot make your environment safe or take responsibility for what happens within your facility, you have no business being in childcare.",

The teachers at Alpine, specifically my daughters teachers are so warm and welcoming each day. Although I’ve been told the building was an older church, the rooms are well equipped  the outdoor yards are new with that synthetic turf and regular walks to the neighbourhood park are a bonus. I’ve registered my oldest for kindergarten with Ms Nikki (as the other parents raved about how much their kids learned this year) she loves her class and teachers Ms Krystal & Ms Emma ,  begging me to hurry to get to school each morning. I am glad to keep her one more year in a smaller environment without big city bussing to/from school) My toddler has now turned 3 which means she just joined the Jr Montessori class with Ms Sara. Looking forward to no more diapers as they have helped potty train. I think most of teachers have been here a while and seem happy. I’ve also met one of the family owners a few times now - nice to know she frequents regularily... Thank you ladies at Alpine!",

They juggle the varying needs of the children in their care seamlessly while also meeting the requests and preferences us parents have. They worked with us to ensure the needs of our children are continually met and effectively communicate their processes when helping teach the children new skills – whether it be potty training, nap training, making new friends or learning a new skill.\n\nBoth my daughter and son love going to daycare each morning. The consistent, clear communication used to speak to and teach our children is truly beyond our expectations; we have the utmost confidence our kids are in the best care available.\n\nThe safe, caring environment has allowed our daughter and son to make amazing friendships with the providers and children within the Art and Soul Montessori program. We are constantly grateful for the top-notch care they receive each day.\n\nWe have had a wonderful experience and would not hesitate to recommend Art and Soul Montessori for any childcare needs.",

There is a notable difference in the personality of kids who attend Aspen Hill Montessori when it comes to discipline, independence and social interactions. In terms of school administration, school has strict policies but  I feel it is necessary to run the school effectively. My experience with the administration team has always been pleasant and easy.

Luches fed daily contradicted the calender posted.  In my opinion, there appears to be no structure at all and I'm very sure our child learned nothing while there.  In my expierence, the owner is unreasonable, overly defensive and not solution oriented.  Care giver turnover is very large.

My child goes to RM Royal Daycare already 6 month and there is something what I really want to tell.\nWe came from Ukraine and my child didn’t speak English at all. First weeks it was really hard for him and for as a parents. But with staff, with teachers from RM Royal daycare this time became a beautiful.\nMy son looks forward to going there every day. Sometimes he doesn’t want to go home when we pick him up:))\nDuring the day I receive photos of my son and how is his day going, what kind of food is he eating, what kind of activities does he has.\nTeachers there are extremely nice, friendly. They always understand what child wants and they know each child very good.\n\nEvery time teachers telling me stories about my son, what he likes to do the most, his behavior in different situations. He already speaks English good with such a great support from teachers and he has learned so much since going here!\nChildren are growing up in such a great place with a lot of activities!\n\nTeachers have an individual approach to each child. Our son is in the safe place and I know when we drop our son off every morning - he will be well taken care of.\n\nI’m glad I found them!",

This is his last year there and reflecting back I have to say that the caregivers have done an excellent job in helping raise my son.\n\nI  credit the team with potty training him, trying new foods, teaching him respect and manners just to name a few.  Over the years there has been plenty of impressive activities such as yoga, dance, singing, Christmas concerts, show & tell and even the odd field trip in the neighborhood.\nThe facility is professionally set up and well maintained as a daycare and has dedicated areas geared towards the specific groups to aid in their development at their specific age range.\n\nThe caregivers/teachers are all professional accredited and certified and genuinely care bout the children.  My son has learned to read and write all of the alphabet as well as numbers to 20 and they have now even started simple math additions.\n\nThe location is extremely handy being just of of Bow Trail and the hours are exceptional compared to other places.\n\nThank you Bow Trail Daycare!",

My child learned so much from the staff at this daycare and they made sure that the transition to Kindergarten will be easy for my child.\n\nThey have so many resources if you need help. If they think your child is in need of help with speech or mortar skills, they will get someone to come and help your child so school will be easier for them.\n\nFurthermore, Brentwood childcare is clean, safe and fun! Thanks Brentwood Childcare Center for caring and loving my child!",

        "text": "A million stars!!  My son attends Acadia Brightpath and he has learnt so much already and he's been there just about 6 months.  Understandably sending your child into childcare however that looks for you can be difficult but the care and attention from the staff for my son has been absolutely fantastic. They made the transition so easy for my husband, our son and I which helped with the fears and anxieties surrounding a change like this.  I would forever recommend Acadia Brightpath for anyone sending their child into care, the staff care for your kids like they're their own and it really shows, our son loves being there.  They don't just watch your kids either they play with them, help them learn, teach new things (our son now knows the sign for more which is so adorable 🥰), get down and actually spend time with them especially if they're new to the room.\nIt's all just so comforting to have people who care like this looking after our precious children❤️\n1000/10 would always recommend!!!",

Everyone at Creekside - literally from the Director, to the floor managers, to their teachers, to their absolutely remarkable admin staff - is warm, welcoming, receptive to open communication about any concern you may have, and genuinely excited to spend the day with your kid.

The development of skills in our son have been enhanced and his ability towards speaking, listening, eye contact, behaviors, friendliness - I mean everything has been developed with the activities & learning patterns they have been developing for kids on daily basis.\n\nHe recently graduate as a Toddler to the new class Room # 2 as his transition was very smooth to the new environment. They gradually introduced him to the new class once a week then twice and then fulltime slowly. Again the support of all the teachers in this room-2 was amazing during this transition period. I would say they have one of the best Educated &  Experienced staff members. They recently celebrated his Birthday at the day care and due to Health concerns they baked an Inhouse cake for his celebration - which just surprised us, we are very thank full for thinking about the safety of all kids and teachers, i would say BIG kudos to the Directors & Teachers of the facility.\n\nLong story short this is an amazing day care facility in this area and this is truly meant for the bright future path of our kids. The staff at this facility has been working Tirelessly in these tough times and have been immensely supportive. BIG THANK YOU !",

They have a great curriculum and I receive updates monthly on what the primary focus of their learning will be that month. I also receive daily updates and photos on what my son is learning for the day, what he eats, when and how long he naps, ect. The educators are so caring and attentive to the children.  My son has food allergies that the educators take very seriously and they ensure that all new staff are notified. My son comes home learning something new everyday and has made friends as well! we love BrightPath and are very happy with our choice in childcare. Our number one priority is that our son is learning in a safe, happy and interactive environment where he is cared for and brightpath has checked off all the boxes. Thank you!",

They made this transition such an amazing and positive experience for our family. It was clear how comfortable and safe our son felt with them immediately; he absolutely adored them and it was clear they felt the same. The relief we felt as parents, because of this, was immeasurable.\n\nHe just recently moved on to the toddler room and although we are very sad to be leaving Anita and Ranjiv, we know that he is ready for that transition, and he will form new bonds with the wonderful educators in that room.\n\nIn addition to the educators, both Shabnam and Amarjot (center directors) are always so helpful, communicative and responsive.\nWe would 100% recommend this facility to anyone looking for a daycare for their children.\n\nBryn Jones",

My son's teachers were well-informed about his developmental phases and milestones. They were there for him when he faced difficulties. As a starting English speaker, Ms. Shabnam assisted my kid in his mother tongue language and I could go to her for advice if I needed it. Children are always given age-appropriate and open-ended learning opportunities by their caregivers. My son gained a variety of skills, including the development of his social and emotional skills, as well as the ability to build relationships with children, share and take turns, listen, and communicate his emotions. My kid and the other children are cared for by the educators in a loving and compassionate way. They feel happy, safe and excited to learn and explore their interests.

When a spot opened up to us for our 1 year old, I knew I had to jump on it, even though we were already enrolled elsewhere to start. From the beginning they have been informative, helpful, kind and supportive offering any help to ease our transition for our son and family. I trust this daycare, even being here a short time, we love his teachers - and have witnessed their loving and gentle attitudes towards our son, and the community of families have been so warm and welcoming to us. We are truly grateful to have the privilege in enrolling here and hope to bring all our future kids here as well! This daycare knows their stuff, know how to provide great activities, meal menus and they pay close attention to every child’s individual needs. Hands down, the best there is! Thank you again and again.",

        "text": "My son and daughter both currently attend BrightPath McKenzie and I truly cannot say enough positive things.  I was initially nervous about sending them to a daycare vs. a dayhome, thinking they would not receive any love and affection; however, this is so far from the truth.  They receive so much love and affection and are cared for by EVERYONE at the daycare, not just their teachers.  As you walk through the hallways all staff is so friendly and say hi.  My children know basically all of the staffs' names and this was something that really stood out to me in a positive light.  The meals they are fed are fabulous and I have found it has really helped open their horizon - things you would assume they would never eat at home, they are eating happily here!  And of course, they learn so much!  They follow a fantastic, age appropriate, curriculum and I have noticed such growth in both my children.  I could go on and on with all the positive things I have to say :)",

There is opportunity for outdoor time in both summer and winter with age appropriate areas/activities. There is also an indoor gym/area when the weather does not cooperate.\n\nThe staff in the rooms is attentive and engaging with the children. This is in contrast to our experience with a different daycare where the staff paid more attention to their mobile devices.\n\nThere are special planned activities throughout the month (fun hair day, stuffie day, sprinkler day, etc.) that go over and above the normal learning program provided.\n\nAs with most care facilities in Calgary, there was a considerable waitlist. I'm not sure if that is still the case now. Even so, we are happy that with the switch from a different provider.",

When my oldest had BIG emotions and challenging behaviours I witnessed he and other children being met with hugs and compassion; being allowed to talk with their teachers till they feel better. I always get feedback and they are so transparent about what is happening- updates on the new things my kids are doing are so incredibly appreciated because without the anecdotes, pictures and stories it’s hard to know you’re missing them. I love when I get a funny story at pick up, ant other centres I never had any clue about their day. I can tell they all really enjoy what they do. It comes through in their way with the kids and the activities they plan.",

The curriculum and nutrition is currated with littles in mind and is always changing and keeping the kids engaged. Choosing a daycare is hard, but I feel comfortable everyday with the care provided to my child and that I've made the right choice. Thanks to all that make BrightPath Rundle such a fantastic place.",

They had Chase from Paw Patrol, Moana and Belle come and do a meet and greet with them during the ceremony, goodie bags, and then lunch afterwards for everyone to attend.

Our daughter began daycare here at just under 1 year and stayed til she turned 3, I can honestly say I would not have wanted anything different for her. The staff are all wonderful, caring and gentle people. The care is excellent. The facility is a little aging but very quaint, secure, safe and homey. I highly recommend taking a tour if you are looking for a childcare option.",

My child attended no more than 3 days at one of their day homes and my child broke out in what appears to be hives or some virus. A day after picking up my child I noticed that he was incoherent and was not able to respond to me like he usually does. I paid full fee and when I asked for my money back hours before they close they told me I have to wait until after the holiday. These people don’t care about your child. They could care less. They will put you on the back burner especially if you choose to discontinue your agreement with them. They never asked me if my child was okay or if they could help. Most parents have no idea what these people are feeding their child. It’s a sad system and sad reality. And a lot is going on that parents don’t know. When I told the care giver to not give my child meat and rice and foods we don’t eat at home they still did it anyway, which lead to sickness and now added problems. They do not care about your requests which are different for different children.\n\nI am appalled by the treatment and disregard for a little child who is now suffering. I have no choice but to go to the hospital to figure out if my child is okay.\n\nJust be aware of whom you choose to leave your child with.\n\nUpdate: I received only a portion of money back for the days not used. Thanks for returning money. If you choose to use a dayhome from this agency be sure to do lots of research beforehand. Good luck.",

Lastly, I felt humiliated at the school in a way, because of the financial difference between me and my peers.

The French learning - although not as intense intense as a fully French school - is great and the fact that they learn Spanish in grade 4 is even better. Class sizes are small (rarely above 20 students) and there is a lot of support from different learning specialists should the child need it. Highly recommend a visit if the occasion arises",

At the time I did not know what bullying was or how much it hurts for the who is the bully and for who is being bullied.\nWhen I went into grade 4, the same kid who bullied my friend started bullying me, that was a big impact in my life. After a year of bullying,me and my family decided to leave and find a better school for me.\nI have to say my teacher knew of what was happening and nothing seemed to change; but not only was I bullied from a student but from my teacher as well!! my teacher did not encourage me in a way that was beneficial to me, instead she made me feel bad about myself because I was not able to  understand math as well as others. Still nowadays I still feel like I’m bad at math no matter what.\n\nLast week I talked to a friend about the CWS and she told me there is still bullying going on there, more then 4 kids have already left school because of bullying, from the same person and nothing still hasn’t been done.\nI feel sad for other kids who have been bullied just like me. It’s not a kid’s thing to do and it’s not ok. Waldorf school is a great place to learn in but just because it’s Waldorf doesn’t mean it will be always good.

        "text": "I was hired as a lead teacher in the kindergarten at Calgary Waldorf School four years ago. Someone I worked with made malicious complaints about my professional conduct, solely for the purpose of causing me harm. I found it extremely difficult to  weather the storm that was brought down on me.\n\nI felt humiliated by rumors in the parent community, and lost the confidence to face other teachers because I underwent an investigation due to the complaints. All this happened in the first month of my employment! Unfortunately, irreparable harm had been done, such that months later I would be confronted by an intimidating parent who wanted to start a physical altercation with me. He noted that I habitually came to school before anyone else arrived, and he waited for me. He cornered me in an empty building and was about to assault me, until he noticed my five year old daughter was with me. Thankfully, he did not perpetrate any physical harm to my body. Luckily for me, the principal was there and called the police immediately. Looking back, I can't understand how I had the strength to go through so much and still focus on my work of caring for the wellbeing of the children in my classroom.\n\nI feel grateful to have had a few class parents, colleagues, and an administrator who were still able to see the good in me and in my work with the children. They helped me through what became an uncomfortable year of struggling to recover my confidence. I don't know how else I could have survived a year in which my dignity was taken away so callously. Because of a few decent people, I would have even stayed to teach another year at the school, but I had to move away as soon as summer break started.\n\nBefore leaving Calgary Waldorf School, the principal would write me a recommendation letter to say that I \"continue to work collaboratively with [my] colleagues to provide a warm, caring and enriching environment for the young children in [the] kindergarten.\" She was the only administrator who had the humanity to reach out and acknowledge that I had gone through a lot that year, and had done so with grace.\n\nFour years on, I write this review because I'm still trying to recover from the pain and loss and grief that I went through in that intense year of teaching at CWS. I believe that the way that my situation was handled was problematic, and perhaps not entirely ethical. I've since learned how to deal with grief in a way that I can keep a healthy and productive level of self-esteem intact in the face of challenges. I guess you could say I've forgiven the school, but haven't forgotten it. That year Calgary Waldorf School left an indelible impression on me.",

        "text": "Our journey at the Calgary Waldorf School began with the Parent & Tot class 15 years ago and though our youngest of two is graduating from grade 9 in a couple of weeks, our relationship with the school will not end. That's because through all of these years, our kids have been blessed with wonderful teachers who at their core are conscientious, diligent and loving, know their students like the back of their hands, have expertise in creating a community for not just the students to learn and flourish in but for the parents to enjoy as well from class 1 on. No organization I've been involved with has as much heart, faithfulness to their longstanding guiding philosophy, and is as well run as the Calgary Waldorf School. No organization is perfect but this school learns from and responds to its trials ethically and responsibly. My kids particularly benefited from the junior high sports program which welcomes any student interested to participate in all of the sports, or as many as they want, throughout the school year. I've been involved as a coach and assistant coach on some of these teams and to see not only the growth over three years in the competence of the team but the strengthening of the student relationships through sport has been such a privilege to behold.",

        "text": "We absolutely love the Calgary Waldorf School! As a parent who was not familiar with Waldorf education at all, I am so happy to have found such a beautiful + nurturing space for my children. We were initially recommended to this school by an occupational therapist with the Children's Hospital. The Kindergarten was instrumental in our child's physical development and confidence. I credit the school's focus on sensory experiences, like outdoor play and handwork activities. Calgary Waldorf offers a lovely community for parents to connect with each other and stay involved in their children's education.\n\nI would highly recommend touring the school and talking to the parents that actually have children here if you are interested. I have yet to meet anyone here who has not been satisfied with the education their children have received. We are so lucky to have local school that recognizes play as a foundation for healthy development.",

        "text": "I do NOT recommend this place. I doubt the personnel's qualifications. It is located in a convenient location, and it is cheap, but they don't have any resources to help your child to develop through play. The teacher doesn't have the skills to manage difficult kids, and they don't promote a healthy environment for other kids. The food is low quality and has no nutritional value. The teacher gives candies to the kids to make them behave, which I found a very wrong approach, especially when they don't ask you if it is ok to give sugar to your kid. They don't care about children's feelings and emotional development. The manager is amiable and tries to listen to your concerns but inside the classroom is another story. After two weeks, I knew it was the wrong choice; I had to stay for three months waiting for an opening in another location; that was the only reason to stay. The picture of the white paper is one of my son's crafts in cancare. Even my son asked me why he was not doing any crafts or any activity anymore. He was in another daycare before, and the following picture is the kind of thing he used to do there, nothing special, but some paint and dedication make the difference. I never saw a teacher engaged with the kids in any activity besides reading a book. Not to mention it is dirty and messy; there is a mess at the entrance with everyone in the center shoes that is a total muddy mess. Kids don't have a cabinet reachable for their belongs.\nYou kid deserve better!",

We decided to stop sending him to this daycare for personal reasons. When we went to collect his belongs, which includes 2 bottles that we left there for him to use. We left the bottles there as we were promised that these would be cleaned/sanitized on a daily basis. However, we found mold in the straw in one of the bottles. Yes, mold in the clear straw. And it is a bottle that he uses everyday. We emailed the daycare just to tell them about this because we don’t want this to happen to other kids. We didn’t hear anything back, not even an apology.\nThe daycare would know who I am by reading this. We are not here to tell you to not send your kids there.

They treat each child as if they were their own, and it truly shows. My son adores them and has formed a strong bond with both of them. Their nurturing approach, patience, and ability to make learning fun have made a world of difference in his development.\n\nThey provide a diverse range of meals, ensuring that my son is not only well-fed but also exposed to different foods from a young age. It's reassuring to know that he's getting the balanced diet he needs to thrive.\n\nThe creative side of this preschool is simply amazing. My son comes home with beautiful crafts and art projects on a regular basis. It's evident that the teachers encourage his creativity and help him explore his artistic talents. The pride he takes in showing us his creations is priceless.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and enriching environment for their child. Luisa and Laura, along with the entire staff, go above and beyond to make every child feel special and cherished. I feel truly fortunate to have found such a wonderful place for my son's early education. Thank you to everyone at the preschool for the exceptional care and support you provide.",

This was the first daycare she has been to , and the staff did everything to make a smooth transition. They had floating teachers to help with the new children and give them on one one attention, the teachers all make the children feel sooooo loved and welcomed. I've observed the way that they handle conflict with other kids, and tantrums, tip-top in their empathy and de-escalating. There's a huge indoor gym where kids can play and get physical activity on colder days, and a pretty decent outdoor spot with a good assortment of age-appropriate playground equipment. They provide meals for your kids, and take them out for picnics and walks to get fresh air- weather permitting. Flexible plans for new-to-daycare parents to transition their kids (which many daycares don't allow), and they also helped during our move to accommodate her an extra day after our agreement.\nLove love love chapter 1 downtown.\n\nanother great thing thats unique about this daycare- the walls between classes go up halfway- so teachers can see each other across classes, which increases accountability and transparency and allows for easy assistance if needed in one room!\n\nand did i mention their prices are one of the cheapest, with the lowest deposit for daycares in downtown calgary?\n\nThank you Chapter one team for a wonderful time!",

My first child attended for four years, and my second child was there two years.\n\nThe staff are incredibly kind and loving to the children, and it was heartwarming to see the bonds my children created with them. Importantly, staff is generally very consistent without much turnover so you can count on stability for your child.\n\nThe Daycare layout was one of the key reasons I chose Chapter 1 back in 2018. Rather than individual enclosed rooms, it is one big wide open room, separated by low walls, bookcases, and gates. I liked the fact that caretakers were able to look over at one another, for reasons that: 1) caretakers could easy signal for help if they need support from coworkers, and 2) less private spaces = more personal security for a child. (Bonus: it was also nice that my eldest could hear her sibling, look over at him, and support him on his hard days if needed.)\n\nWe got lots of art daily, my kids learned a ton and are well set up for their next schooling endeavours, and as parents we felt very involved throughout the years. The staff went above and beyond to host holiday and milestone events with kids & parents, and I will very much miss being part of the Chapter 1 family.\n\nThank you so much for everything you've done for my kids and family.

        "text": "Disorganized and rude staff, old facilities with dirty run down carpets. The way they respond to negative reviews is exactly the way they treat parents if any issues are brought up. They will \"deny registration\" and ask you to find another daycare for your child giving you a \"sufficient notice\" of 3 days to make new arrangements. They expected us to pay a daily drop in of $50 during those days. First day they didn't expect my 1 year old. There was confusion and unattended parents and babies at the main door. My son was handed to the toddler's room caregiver and only one caregiver was looking after 7 babies in the babies area. They seemed understaffed. The toddler and baby areas were not separated by any structure and toddlers just run around everywhere. I noticed all the babies were in high chairs the entire time I was there (45 min and it wasn't during a meal), and my husband said he found them in the chairs in the afternoon too when he picked him up. Perhaps a byproduct of being short staffed that day? or the fact that the babies and toddler room are one and the same and there is no way for babies to walk around safely or sit on the floor. It made me wonder how long my baby sat in the chair the whole day. I emailed the director and stressed that Alberta requires a max of 4 babies per caregiver. They said they were compliant with that rule and that first day of the month is usually busier, hence the confusion. I went with it and sent him in again next day, but had the exact same experience. In the afternoon he came back and threw up his lunch. I emailed her and asked her to investigate and that in the meantime I would pack his food. She responded that that was prohibited (it's not allowed, explained to me as almost a breach in the law!?!) and that due to my son's \"high developmental needs\" they could not receive him anymore. She gave me 3 days to find a new daycare! She also said they would charge me $50 daily from that day on (they did refund me in full for the first month tho). I have a full time job and scrambled to find a new place for him but I am so glad I did. I didn't feel my baby was safe or happy at this daycare",

I toured a number of facilities but from the moment I entered CEC, I knew it was the right fit for our family. Our daughter absolutely loves attending and it's amazing to see how much her personality and skills have developed.\n\nAll the staff, from the director to the educators to the on-site cook, are incredible.  The educators truly care and their dedication to all aspects of child develop truly shows.  The on-site cook is second to none.  As my daughter says, all meals at the center are 'Delicious'!  Since placing my daughter on the waitlist, we've had absolutely no issues with communication from the center.  The director is always on top of her game and provides regular updates and reports to the parents.\n\nI am so happy we found Child Enrichment Center and can't recommend it enough!",

If that was different, she would still be there and I would have given a higher rating! Another parent told me that it is against the law for them to do that. I have no idea how to find out if that is true or not! I also found that she was eating the same thing there a lot, some type of soup. No idea where it came from or what was in it, that also makes me uncomfortable because nutrition is important! Also if your child gets hurt there, their procedures kind of suck. For a daycare that has been there for so long, I was surprised that they're not more on top of things like becoming more modern to keep clients. My neighbors daughter went there 30 - 40 years ago, and it doesnt seem like much has changed at all since then.",

He connected very well with the staff and they were all super friendly and caring.  It was then when I decided to register him for full time preschool. He’s learns so much everyday and the communication and daily reports from the staff shows they go above and beyond and truly love what they do and the children. It has made bedtime super easy as he says “I want to go to bed mommy so I can go to school tomorrow!” That shows me how much he truly enjoys going everyday.

        "text": "OK, after having my daughter there for a year, this is my honest opinion.\nI'll start with the good: the teachers. The only reason why my daughter stayed in that daycare for so long were the teachers. You will not find more caring and involved daycare teachers than these ones and their guidance turned her from a shy girl that wouldn't speak to an outgoing cheerful kiddo. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\nFor us that was the most important thing. For the kindness of the teachers we would have tolerated everything else a.k.a \"the bad\".\nThe bad:\nAdministration - everything they could have messed up they did. My recommendation is to have everything they say in writing.\nThey are super expensive. First they introduced a \"food fee\" of $180 on top of the fees that were there originally. If my kid eats $180 worth of food in addition to the original price, I'd expect more than soups and crackers 2x/weeks.\nThe responses to some negative reviews here will tell you more about the arrogance of the owner than I can in my short review here. (correction: they've deleted them since a few months ago when I was reading them - still indicative)\n\nIn conclusion, if you want your kid to be amongst amazing caring teachers this is the place to be. To us, everything else was secondary to that. But also be prepared to deal with semi-competent administration and ask for everything in writing.",

The centre did an awesome job throughout the pandemic, with communication, protocols, and responding to parents. This facility is beautiful, as I've heard the new location is as well.\n\nMy 4 year old says that her favourite part is doing crafts (they do them nearly every day). My 2 year old says outside (they have an awesome rooftop playground and indoor gym for smokey/cold days) and Shannon (her daycare mommy who is one of her favourite people in the world). Both of my girls love it there and have done wonderfully. A nanny would be basically the same cost for us with two kids, but I wouldn't consider it for a second. The socialization has been fantastic, and the daycare very responsive to all of my (often annoying) requests. The food is great, they are awesome at uploading information and pictures to the app, and for me it really checks all the boxes.\n\nThe only thing that I don't love is that they don't allow parents to access the video streams of the class rooms like Kids and Company does. However, they do have cameras (the parents at the time they were installed opted not to have access so you can't really blame the centre) so if there are issues, they can check. That being said, I haven't had any issues that would warrant that type of request.\n\nI also love that they have multiple locations and kindergarten options. My kids will for sure be at one of their locations until they go to school!",

Most importantly, the educators truly educate! These children are not too young for serious learning, and well-informed practices are so impressive. Unlike other childcare, this is not a place where they will just keep your child alive until you get back. The growth and learning in these tiny people is real.",

If outdoors and play-based learning is important for you -  this is the best preschool program! The projects the teachers lead are mindful, fun, and so creative. For parents starting the preschool program, my advice is to be patient at the beginning. Once the kids get to know each other and get in the groove of child-led play, the program really takes off. My other son has participated in the summer programs, and has loved them too. Highly highly recommend Common Digs.",

When I asked the nearest staff member where my daughters mitts and gloves were she immediately responded with attitude “well your child will have to keep them on.” My daughter is 3 years old, she needs to be reminded to keep her mittens on and she may even need help doing so. The staff member then said “she could have left them somewhere” we later learned that she had put them down in the park and they had gotten lost. Brand new pair of mittens and hat. I thought the low teacher-to-child ratio made a difference but apparently it does not. I’m also a person of “color” in this racist town so that could have been a factor in taking care of my child - we know we will be told otherwise but hey I just thought that bit of context would matter to other BIPOC people (iykyk). I don’t trust many child care places and this was a last straw scenario for me.",

Everyone took such good care of him and every morning when I dropped him off, he was so excited to get to his classroom. It was so hard dropping him off, but seeing his smile and how comfortable he was with all his teachers made it so much easier. The pictures that they sent through the app showed all the fun and engaging activities that they do.  They also got him to eat his meals during the day, especially his vegetables which he wasn't eating at home.  I can clearly see the love and care that everyone has for the kids and I know that my son is in good hands. In the end, it was hard to take him out because I know that he enjoys it there so much. I am so grateful that my son had the experiences at Curious Kids and I am hoping that he can return soon with his new baby brother.",

We were there right when the daycare opened, so I’m not sure if they just couldn’t find staff that wanted to work there or not. I found that the inconsistency with staff wasn’t great and my daughter would get used to one person and then all of a sudden there was another. I also found that she was sick almost constantly at this daycare…I was paying for full-time and she was there maybe half the month every month. Last, sometimes when my daughter was having a sick day, there would be updates on the app they use about how she ate a whole meal and took a nap etc. It made me feel like maybe when she was at daycare they were just updating the app to make it sound like she was eating/sleeping. Since then (January) she’s been at a home daycare and hasn’t been sick once. I know a lot of this isn’t controllable, but it was my experience.",

Really great actually, hence why I’m so frustrated its come to this and  Sadly I’ve reached heads with the management.\n\nKids were playing tag , and my son was supposedly blocked/cornered so he punched the kid feeling teased and well cornered. While I acknowledge the wrongness of this the director has failed to understand that notifying me at pick up rather then 2 Pm when it happened that she was suspending him the following day, makes it super difficult if not impossible to find last min care.\n\nI frustratedly expressed that the following work day would be much more suitable,  and allow us time to explain to our employers the situation. When she failed to see my side side;  i wanted to simply leave, to which I was informed that since I couldn’t see her side and fully agree that only she was right, and that we’ve butted heads over a small fee miscommunication in the past she no longer wanted my son in her program , leaving me with 5 days to find a new program.\n( but my daughter can stay ?)\nI will no longer be dealing with the management here, and will leave all future dealings with them\nUp to the wife, as my daughter still attends here. Threatening or promising to remove my son at month end because I was frustrated about the time of choice, and wanting to come back when we were both calmer is a  Very unprofessional way to end a relationship, let alone one with a child.\n\nSo if you’ve read this far , y’a 3-5 stars from a kids point of view depending on the day , but 1 star on my part for the way management just handled this.",

It was the most difficult thing for me to move Aden to another day care.\nAden was treated like their own child, he had so many caring teachers. He learnt the most important basics and I am so happy for the 2 years he spent there which set him up well for his move to other ventures ahead in life.\n\nI remember Ms Mariyama, Ms Nabel , Ms Joan and Ms Harman for all the love and care they have Aden in his time there.\n\nWe will be dropping by to meet and greet as he grows older.\nAll the best, your day care is more than a day care with genuine, loving caregivers.\nRohit and Dipti .\n( I have attached his farewell card , it was so moving to see the love in words, thank you for the amazing culture and real words)",

Our son, is often slow to adjust to new situations and people, so it was a big change when we moved him and his sister from a dayhome to here. Since that time, he has become much better adapted and matured in so many ways since being enrolled. Thanks to the dedicated owner and the lovely staff, as you can tell it’s a very positive and cohesive team. Dropping my children off is now 1000% less stressful as we know both our son and daughter are in very caring hands and are happy at drop off time. Keep up the good work in the staff you employ and also in maintaining quality and care in the educational programs provided.",

I worked in another room. My daughter was allowed to play with scissors and cut up all her pairs of pants they wouldn't help her use the potty.  I was bullied by my own boss at this daycare. The husband didn't have his level one and had to have me and his wife Julia to do the questions and answers for him because he doesnt know how to speak well English or understand much English because he wasn't allowed to take this kids in the van alone without his level one child care at the time Licensing came and to tell Julia that I had to take all the kids out of the van at very stop but they said that was to much work and that we shouldn't have to do that. They never washed the toys. They wouldn't make enough food for the kids to eat. They always were still hungry at the time but Julia said that's all they had for them. One another time I wasn't walking the children and children told me something that happened and the another worker should have reported it as she seen it happen and Julia locked me in her office till I wrote a statement for something I didn't see. I cried in the office till I was supposed to pick up another children from the school bus. I wiped my tears away and still went to go get the child and than I came back she put me back into her office till I wrote it as there wasn't anyone in my room watching the children so I went back to the children finished the day. The next day I gave my two weeks notice and took my daughter out of that daycare ASAP. Her husband didn't even know how to speak English well so truly. So if you think about putting your kids with this daycare just remember her husband didn't get his level one without his wife and I having to answer questions as I had to go to school for it. He had no schooling for child care when I went there.\n\nI truly don't recommend this daycare.",

My grand baby always came home starving. They fed him very little. He was sent home with other kids diapers, clothes. The daycare would not let you come in to the daycare. You had to wait outside. We live close by so when my son in law watched him play outside at the daycare he was told he was not allowed to watch. The staff are rude to the parents . My grandson was being hit by another child in the daycare and they did nothing about it. But most of all my grand baby would cry when they dropped him off so something was going on , he feared this daycare. He is now in a new daycare that sends pics of all his activities, what he ate etc. he is very happy. I would not consider this daycare  at all",

My son enrolled at 10 months and I'm so glad I chose Edgemont because they have made his daycare experience the best. He's happy getting to daycare (gets excited and claps his hands when he sees the daycare sign) but is still happy to come home with us haha. One of the daycare ladies treats my son like her own son!

My son seems very happy there and he adjusted well to the transition. They always seem to go the extra mile at Expanding Imaginations and I am so happy we found a spot at this day care!",

Their dedication, kindness and professionalism is incredible. Our son thrived here. Their in-house chef created delicious food, our son ate everything. The staff have been here for years, so there is very little teacher turnover. The variation in rooms and options of indoor exercise rooms and a magic room were wonderful in the cold Calgary winters.

And about the events, I don't have any concerns because they are flexible and open-minded. For example, on Halloween, I told them I’m not particularly eager to send my kids this day, and they accept that in a very welcome way.

        "text": "TLDR: The people at the head of this company do not care about your children’s wellbeing. Do not be fooled by the marketing team’s stellar job of selling you this childcare program. From the money hungry management’s total lack of empathy to a full-blown e coli outbreak which has hospitalized many children, this is not a safe place to send your kids. Stay far away from Fueling Brains Academy.\n\nFueling Brains. You are a childcare organization. You are not a tech giant. You are not Google, or Meta, or Apple. You hold responsibility for the wellbeing and development of children. They rely on you just as their parents rely on you to take their children’s care seriously. There is absolutely no excuse for running a company in this line of business with the intention to maximize profit, scale up and reap the rewards at the expense of young lives and their parent’s wallets. Your goals should not be centered around growth at all costs. You are a childcare organization.\n\nFueling Brains Academy has sold out your children, substituting quality childcare to infect themselves with a toxic malady that plagues so many businesses of the 21st century: the idea that appearances are more valuable than implementation.\n\nI speak from experience. My child attended Fueling Brains. This company is responsible for the hospitalization of children enrolled at their Calgary campuses due to an e coli outbreak they neglected to prevent. A lot more than just bad food has been served up to our kids though. How about a side of permanent organ damage and weeks in the hospital on dialysis? Do not let these crooks get away with what they have done. Do not allow their finely tuned marketing machine to erase this atrocity from the records. Do not let them skirt their responsibility.\n\nThe food my child and countless others were being served every day was being prepared in a kitchen that had a known cockroach infestation and was not being cleaned properly with bleach or the mandatory sanitization products. This food was then being transported in non-temperature controlled vehicles, five days a week. Fueling Brains may be embedded in their branding, but do not be fooled. They’ve managed to fuel our kid’s healthy bodies with sickness and disease in equal measure - source: https://ephisahs.albertahealthservices.ca/facilitydetails/?id=a2deaeb4-e1f3-e811-a977-000d3af490cc&fbclid=IwAR2tDbeVMUDoWJ1xpbTzCALJyi38TY85Ps8LD4Mt4QfP20DI__f-CoB1NLs\n\nWhat started as an honest effort under the former “Kids U” brand, where the aim was to give your children a Montessori and Reggio inspired learning environment that put their needs first, has become corrupted by greed. It is my opinion that the leadership should be thrown in jail for the way they’ve run this company into the ground and put countless lives in danger.\n\nSince their quest for expansion began, Fueling Brains has outsourced most of its administrative jobs to places like Texas and India, looking to cut cost, find tax loopholes and, essentially, earn themselves as much money as possible. The implementation of their educational programming has declined as a result of their priority shift. This is not the same institution it once was. They claim to be looking out for your kid’s best interests yet are so far removed from the City of Calgary it’s no surprise that they were so oblivious to the violations occurring in their own kitchens. They know precisely what they are doing when it comes to making money, these people are not daft. Your child's wellbeing, however? They could care less.\n\nTo each and every one of you operating above the primary care staff (who are the real unsung heroes, by the way), I hope you realize the damage you’ve caused to honest families and innocent children. Perhaps your disgrace will cause you to live the rest of your professional lives with a sullied reputation. Perhaps you'll learn some sort of lesson from what you've done. Best of luck to you in legal hell. Maybe all that money you made selling out innocent kids and their families will get you out of it.",

Many of the days off are not stat holidays and leave parents scrambling to take off work.\nThe communication leaves something to be desired as well. They are not clear and concise about any decisions made to schedules or fees. They require 30 days notice of change in schedule, along with admin fees, but don't abide by their own terms when they want to make a change.\nOverall, I feel robbed. I feel they did my child a disservice by making this about fueling their pockets, instead of fueling brains.\nThe teachers are wonderful, management is abysmal, and this probably explains the high turn over in teachers in the recent months.\nWould not recommend.",

We used to refer this location to friends when run by Jocelyn but have been left frantically searching for other childcare. Our friends who have been referred have also left.\n\nThe classrooms have exploded with kids in the recent years. There are a few amazing teachers (Jesse, Elijah, Diane) but they are understaffed, under resourced and seem to often run over their ratios.\n\nThe KidsU head office is impossible to reach. You can call their their entire directory and no one will pick up. Emails will often be ignored and the campuses/parents are left to fend for themselves.\n\nThey will offer referral programs that will not be honoured. You can sense an overall sentiment that KidsU is focus on running a profitable business rather than passionate about childcare.\n\nThey introduced a new program for the junior level that shifts the children three times a day and constantly breaks up the cohort of children into different groups. The class size is 37. With teachers seeing three different sets of kids, as different groups, each day, you can tell they are struggling to create any personal bonds. The children are moved around at a pace that they don’t remember teachers names and are left without personal connections.\n\nFeedback was shared directly with the program administrators to highlight the challenges in their new program but there isn’t much influence at the campus level.\n\nWe’re happy to be moving on to a new daycare. KidsuU was great up to 2021 but has really lost its way.",

        "text": "I worked as an speech and language aid for certain kids (through another company) at Fueling Brains West 85th for the entire 2022-2023 school year. Here are some alarming things I noticed that I want to share with parents if they plan on or already have their kids enrolled in this school.\n\n1. Kids are not looked after and there are MULTIPLE safety hazards. Many times while doing speech activities with my assigned children, I would have to jump in to make sure the kid jumping of the table didn’t break his head open, or get I would have to get a kid away from trying to break a glass jar. Often, there were too many kids in a classroom (up to 48 children with 6 teachers) for the teachers to pay attention to important safety issues the kids were having. Kids regularly got hurt at this facility.\n\n2. Kids hit, punch, bite, kick, and hurt each other daily. Most teachers would not notice these instances, again because there are so many kids in the classroom, and if they were noticed, sometimes the wrong kid would get in trouble. This is pretty dangerous, and again, I would sometimes jump in (during my speech activities) to help the safety of the children even though it was not my job.\n\n3. Teachers would often yell at the children and use harsh words with them. This is because there was always so much going on and the teachers were frustrated, but it still gave the wrong message to the children.\n\n4. Super high staff turn over. In the 1 year I was there, I saw between 15-25 teachers leave, and only 5 or 6 were there from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. The environment of the school is quite stressful and exhausting, so teachers get burned out easily.\n\nWith all this said, I think it would be a good idea to keep away from Fueling Brains, as I was genuinely concerned for children's safety and well-being while at the school.",

The teachers' unwavering love, care, and involvement made her time there truly remarkable. The professionalism in management ensures a safe and enriching environment.\n\nDuring our daughter's autism diagnosis process, the daycare staff's support was invaluable. They guided us with compassion and understanding, making a challenging time more manageable. As we bid farewell to this incredible place, we're grateful for the core memories it has given our daughter.\n\nHappyTime isn't just a daycare; it's a haven of love and growth. Our deepest gratitude to the entire HappyTime family for their dedication and impact on our lives.",

        "text": "Terrible experience - we toured the facility and they seemed great. One week prior to starting, I inquired about if they had air conditioning, and if not, how they ensured the health and safety of the children in regards to not overheating (it was during a heat wave). I was informed that they did not have any \"fancy temperature measuring devices\" and that no parents had every inquired about it before. If it was hot, they moved in a portable air conditioning unit or opened windows. They determined if it was hot by if the teachers were hot or not. They had no policies in place regarding acceptable temperature ranges for inside (they had rules around outside), nor digital thermometers in the class rooms. I highlighted to them that Calgary had several heat waves over the last two summers, and that other child care facilities that I contacted (including our current one) had air conditioning and a clear policy on the health and safety of the children during heat waves. I was fine with them not having air conditioning, but I needed to know that the room could be maintained at a safe temperature. They could not tell me what the maximum or average temperatures would be in the room, during heat waves.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, I was informed that it was clear I didn't trust them enough to care for my child, so we were not suited for their facility, and they returned my deposit. This left me scrambling to find child care with one week's notice. In discussing this with licensing and health, I was assured that this was a legitimate issue to be inquiring on.\n\nNo child care provider will have my blind trust, and I would expect that every provider would be able to answer basic health and safety questions. Thankfully I was able to get into an alternative facility that was not at all put off when I inquired about how they ensured the health and safety of my child when in their care. Heat waves are a normal part of Calgary summers now, and excessive heat exposure for vulnerable persons (inc children) can be a significant health threat. I am super glad that we are not going to be attending a facility that expects my blind trust when unable to address what should be a simple question (ie. yes, we have digital thermometers in each room, and ensure that they temperature is maintained below 28 degrees during heat waves).",

She learned the alphabets, numbers, simple maths, writing with a pen/pencil, natures like the bugs, plants, and butterflies.  She also learned to take turns, make friends, and play along with others.  Daily picture updates from the teachers on the apps are great.  All in all, Joso is great.

The teachers really love being around the children and it shows. My son always has a smile on his face and has never woken up in 3 years and didn’t want to go. They have exceeded my expectations for reading and writing. He will be going to grade one next year fully able to read level 1 and 2 books independently and can write full sentences. This learning has not come at the expense of free play or creativity. He has told me that he loves having the free play time to be happy and a kid! They have lots of interesting programs and experiences, and I am always amazed how much he is learning disguised as fun. They allow the kids to be curious and creative, and bottom line, I feel safe and comfortable knowing how happy his first experience with school is. My son even has a yoga stretch and meditation practice he enjoys that he learned in school. If you are looking for a place that your child is safe, loved, and happy this is the place for you. This has easily been the hands down best choice we have made for our child!",

The good things about it is that it has an indoor playground, nice and bright rooms. Teachers and supporting staff, most of them, are nice. However, the rooms are not clean. Kids' shoes often found in their beddings or storage for spare cloths. You will find dirt, trash in kids's bedding every Friday when you take it home. You will see teachers are switched everyday between different rooms. Morning and afternoon teachers are also different.

It was a very difficult time for us but Ms. Brenda suggested for him to get tested for being gifted and supported us through the whole journey. She suggested various activities for my son to do during school so that he would stay engaged. All thanks to her, he enjoys his time at Joso's and learned so much socially and academically. I recommend Ms. Brenda and her kinder room to everyone I meet. He was at a very famous private school earlier but had difficult time because he could not fit in. Being in Ms.Brenda's classroom made me realize again how important the educator is. She genuinely loves children and you can see how much she enjoys working with them. The children know this for sure so they love her right back! If it weren't for her, my son would still have difficult time at school and we would be struggling. Thank you so much Ms. Brenda and Ms. Bethany!",

My oldest would cry everyday and he didn’t wanted to go which later I learned that the teachers would hit him in the hand for crying. One day I was at work and my youngest was a little sick when I dropped them off in the morning asked my sister to check on him around 1030 in the morning when she went their she witnessed that at that time they have putten all the kids for nap at 1030 which suppose to be 1200. I don’t know how they have this 5 star review but I took my kids out of their and registers in to another daycare and never had any issue with kids going their they would walk by themselves happily so parents just check in your kids randomly hopefully your kids doesn’t have to suffer as my kids did 😊",

This is extremely serious!\nSo if you live in Calgary southeast and want your kid(s) to receive a great childcare, with strong moral values in a very respectful place, with lovely and professional staff that shows that your child matters you, should definitely book a tour there and chat with Miss Karen!\nOther aspects that I really appreciate are:\n- Cleanliness of the kitchen and the whole place in general.\n- English skills: my son didn’t speak english well when he started, but now he is confident to talk in English everywhere, even to teach me and my husband sometimes 😅\n- They are very accommodating with the process of potting training for each child.\n- Grant & subsidy available\nI definitely love the Kiddies Daycare Center SE, their approach and the fact that they share my values and principles of life!

I wrote a letter to them about how negligence they are. Good they had camera so that I picked her up after watching their camera .

These activities directly impacted the very smooth transition into Kindergarten for our older child and set them up for success.

Fortunately, they were ready for our kids to return when we needed them and we have never once worried about their safety.\n\nI would highly recommend them anyone to that is looking for a high quality daycare.  The facility is spotless, there is a nice secure play area for the children outside, the rooms are large, you can access the building from the +15 and there are designated parking stalls on the ground level for easy drop-off.\n\nWe will miss them when our kids are in school but we will be taking advantage of the summer program for school aged children because we appreciate the way they simplify our lives that much.",

If considering daycare, I highly recommend Kids & Go.",

The daily reports are detailed for each child with accompanying pictures.  The activities and meals are well thought out and the webcam access is a nice feature.\nWhen we moved, Mimi assisted us with the transfer to another location and after a miserable experience at the other location, (where you were treated like a number rather than a human), Mimi was kind and efficient to help with our transition back to Livingston.\nEven with the commute, we are very happy for the oppourtunity to be back at Livingston.  It's a friendly place where ALL of the educators will know your child's name, what interests them, what to say if they are upset and are excited to do it.",

Old toys and old tools even the outdoor areas was not good at all. They were  putting a boy who was crawling in the toddler room where the kids running and walking and he was crying continuously through the day and the teachers did nothing for him. He broke my heart and i was surprised because they asked us to wait in the waiting list tell our daughter exactly 18 months so she can be accepted in the toddler program. We were there only during the transition week and I didn’t put my daughter there but of course they didn’t give us our money back. We lost 500$ because we choosed not to continue with thim.

We feel incredibly lucky to have received the love and care for both our children (like they were their own) and they were legitimately a part of our family for the last 6 years.  Caretakers would take the time to share unique traits or milestones they noticed in our children and we could tell they were as invested in their development as we were.  Also due to the capacity of their location we felt a large sense of community from the other families who were also at this location.

The space is absolutely beautiful - spacious, bright and open with so much room for little ones to run around and explore. The ECEs are so loving and tender with our kiddos. They get to know each one's personality so well and see the best in them like we do. The staff have seemingly endless energy that they bring to caring for the kids. They come up with creative activities to stimulate learning and growth, they have dance parties and do tons of singing. They celebrate birthdays and special occasions with a ton of enthusiasm and fun. The kids are super active all day and the space facilitates this well. My little one went through a period of time where he was biting other kids and it was so tough for me as his mom but ultimately we got through it with lots of communication and support from the staff.

She was always encouraged to be herself and the staff always kept in good contact and good relationship with the parents. On top of it all, they feed the kids healthy organic foods made onsite. Nothing but good things to say for The Pumpkin Patch.",

They let the kids explore and learn through the daily indoor and outdoor activities. I have met with the teachers and the manager many times and they were very patient, well educated, and experts in their job. My son loves his teachers and friends A LOT!! he keep saying their names and gets so excited in the morning! It has been less than 6 months since my son started at this daycare, and I can see the huge improvements in his language, communication, motor skills, and behavior.

At the beginning, my husband and I wasn’t sure if we will register our kids here, because some bad reviews on google. However, we took time to go to the daycare to observe the place, the activities with the kids and to talk with Ms. Francey, not only about the kid’s programs but also about the bad comments. She explained to me why some parents wrote those comments; she also promised to take care of my children as they were her own. We decided to give to her a chance, because she said that she is Christian and we also prefer Christian daycares. I’d never regretted it, because Ms. Francey kept her promise and she also proof her faith in many other ways. She helped us not only to follow special diets for our kids, but also to provide the Montessori program and all the other services for free, when we didn’t have money to pay. I know that Ms. Francey also helped other families that had financial trouble during the covid pandemic. Finally, we decided to homeschool our kids to do what God commanded us to do with them, which also helps our finances, but my kids will always affectionately remember Ms. Francey and other teachers that took good care of them. My children also loved many friends and activities with them in the daycare and Montessori program. It was a great blessing for our family; we are all very thankful and we recommend this daycare with no doubt.",

And doesn't want to come home at the end of the day. The development that my daughter has achieved is more than I expected. Teachers are caring, high trained and very inventive. I like the weekly pictures and updates that we receive by email about our child activities throughout the week. The daycare offers structured schedule that include plenty of time for physical activities, educational activities and quite time. I also appreciate that kids are served with nutritionally balanced meals and snacks. I’m very satisfied with Kids R Fun day care and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for safe, caring, fun and educational place for their kids.",

Everything about this facility is A+++.\n\nThe facility is beautiful, you can tell that they really care about the kids education as well as having fun. Not only do they have a lovely outdoor space for the children they have completely transformed the garage space to an area where the kids can play on those really cold/rainy days. That room consists of individual shops so the kids can play make believe as well as a ball pit! Come on, what child doesn’t love a ball pit?!? The rooms are also equipped with everything the kids need to have a fun filled day.\n\nAll food is made in house by Faye, food is nutritious and food that the kids want to eat! I’m talking spaghetti, lasagna, roasted chicken, pizzas (home made) and even themed food. Thanksgiving, the kids are having a traditional Turkey dinner! And if your child doesn’t like something (my daughter is a very picky eater), Faye always accommodates!\n\nWhen my son started at Kids World just before he turned 2 he wasn’t talking, I was actually getting a little concerned that he was speech delayed. But no, the team brought those words right out of him, he’s talking non stop now after just a month of being at this daycare. Not only is he now a talking machine, they are also teaching him FRENCH! I wasn’t joking, they are amazing! My daughter is 5 and started when she was 4, already pretty advanced for her age I have noticed significant improvements in my daughters vocabulary and communication since going to this daycare.  Oh! And they’ve started potty training my son AT 2!!! Amazing !\n\nThey really treat you like family here, this was my children’s second home and they were very comfortable with the facility and the staff. I used to pick up my kids pretty late and I would always see the staff cleaning and disinfecting, so there’s definitely no worries when it comes to the cleanliness of the facility!\n\nI’ve since moved from Calgary and this is daycare and the staff are the only things I miss about Calgary. I wish I could have taken them back to Toronto with me!\n\nTo the Kids World team, I know you are reading this! The kids and I love you all dearly and miss you!  You all are amazing and heaven sent. Don’t stop caring for children the way you do. You were a blessing to me and my family and I can’t thank you enough for treating my kids like your own and becoming family in our hearts.",

Second, the staff are professionally trained and their CPR and First Aid accreditations are all posted outside the director's office. We need that for our asthmatic daughter. My daughter ❤️ love this daycare. She is always excited to go to this place everyday. The teachers are awesome. The teachers have lots of activities for her. There are countless times that  the teachers spotted my child having an asthma attack and they administered lifesaving inhalers for her right away. I am truly grateful 🙏 to all of them. My child is the only one hence its hard for her to share and took her awhile to build friendship with other kids. But with the help of the teachers she is now very friendly and kind to all the kids wherever she goes. I highly recommend this place so far. They even helped me to organize her first birthday party after the peak of pandemic. I highly recommend this place.",

        "text": "Kinderhaus Academy has been an incredible experience for my son.  As a teacher myself I am incredibly impressed with the school.  His growth and development over the last year was astounding. Geetha is an incredible educator with a wealth of knowledge of child development and it shows with the patience and compassion she has while challenging the children. My son’s confidence has soared. His social skills, self discipline and curiosity has grown by leaps and bounds. Kinderhaus has  a strong sense of what Montessori truly is and it shows with the calm, content and engaged children when you walk into the school. I have nothing but the highest regards for Kinderhaus. As a parent nothing compares to knowing your children are in such wonderful hands when you are at work.",

My daughter had a hard time adjusting since she is new to being with someone else aside from me, she got kicked out after the 4th date because I strongly asked for Ms. NICOLE to help me break her out of the routine of expecting me to pick her up everytime she cries.  Also,  if you tried and asked her to find ways to soothe your child like other caregivers/teacher who are patient, please dont, she will take that personally and your child will be kicked out. It is not an easy feeling for my self as a mother , having to go through alot with my daughter and for the first time ever, trying to introduce her to the outside world and came across such an uncompassionate person like Ms. NICOLE.  PLEASE IF YOU DONT HAVE THE LOVE AND PATIENCE FOR CHILDREN, GET A DIFFERENT JOB!",

I was amazed.\n- I have noticed improvement in my daughter’s socializing skills.\n- If you don’t speak English at home, learning experience would be a great help for your kid.\n- Management and staff are nice and supportive.\n- Clean environment and clean washroom.\n\nI am sure there are more positive points than what I have remembered and listed.

The teachers smiled everytime talking about him. Unfortunately we moved and had to find a closer daycare to our home but we would have loved to stay and thus highly recommend this daycare.

Before finding this beautiful outdoor center, we tried lots of daycare all over the city. They were always missing something: better communication, potty training, outdoor space, passion. Little Forest Dwellers has it all. Beside having a huge, and incredible outdoor space and focusing into lots of nature, we love their commitment, sense of community and support, communication system, and passion for kids.\nI know its hard to find a place that you trust while at the same time wanting to pursue your professional dreams or other compromises. You want a place that offers an equal or better learning environment than the one you have at home. That's what really value about them. They have that (I could never build a backyard like the one they have LOL) + all the staff is so passionate about it.\nWe love them and couldn't recommend it enough!",

The Academy is very much different from other daycares is that they focus on teaching the kids basic foundational skills ( such as activities to help improve and fine and gross motor coordination skills) .  The preschool kids are involved in a variety of purposeful activities that help stimulate their logical (learning the alphabet/numbers, learning different topics such as earth day, etc)  and creative side (growing vegetables in their garden, yoga classes, etc.).  In addition, they also teach the kids in how to manage manage and regulate their emotions by teaching them early techniques of meditation and breathing exercises which is something you don't see in many other daycare facilities.

It's a very convenient location in the Bowness Community Centre and they spend a lot of time outdoors and in the Centre's gym.

        "text": "As a parent, I have a completely different perspective on the daycare and I feel compelled to share my thoughts in response to Jamie's review. While I understand that Jamie's experience may not have been positive, I want to highlight some important aspects that were overlooked.\n\nFirst and foremost, I have  been extremely pleased with the staff and the owner of the daycare. They have been consistently attentive, caring, and professional throughout my child's time there. The dedication and passion they demonstrate in their work is commendable.\n\nRegarding the incident during nap time, it's important to consider that children may sometimes misinterpret or misconstrue statements made by educators. I trust that the daycare staff would not intentionally say anything hurtful or promote gender bias. However, I appreciate Jamie bringing this to our attention, and I'm confident that the daycare management will address the matter appropriately.\n\nRegarding the food, I acknowledge that individual preferences can vary. However, it's important to note that the daycare makes an effort to provide nutritious meals for all children. I have personally witnessed the staff ensuring a balanced and healthy diet for the kids, taking into account dietary restrictions and allergies.\n\nRegarding the disciplinary actions witnessed by Jamie, it's crucial to maintain a safe and disciplined environment for all children. While it may be distressing for some kids to witness disciplinary measures, it's important to understand that the staff's intention is to teach valuable lessons and promote positive behavior. I have seen instances where the staff handles disciplinary matters with fairness and sensitivity.\n\nI want to emphasize that my child has had a positive experience at this daycare. The nurturing environment, engaging activities, and supportive staff have played a significant role in his growth and development. It's unfortunate that Jamie's perception differs from mine, but I believe it's important to consider multiple perspectives when evaluating the quality of a daycare.\n\nIn conclusion, I respect Jamie's decision to share their experience, but I wanted to offer my own perspective as a parent who has been satisfied with the daycare services. Each child's experience can be unique, and I believe it's essential for parents to visit the daycare, interact with the staff, and make an informed decision based on their own observations and the needs of their child.",

        "text": "My son went to this daycare during  kindergarten and now he is about to finish grade one.  Every time we drive by the centre he keeps telling me a year later how much he hated it. I’ve debated writing a review but since he continues to tell me how bad his experience was at this daycare I’m impelled to write some of his feedback that he says about his time at this centre.\n\nOne thing I reported as a parent to his teacher after he came home one day distraught;  was how upset he was because one of the educators watching his class during nap time told them all that “girls are better than boys”    This was extremely unprofessional and hurtful. My son is quite sensitive and always wants to be good so he took it very hard and personal. Even though he was listening and trying to be quiet.\n\nOther things he’s expressed and shared about being there was how awful the sandwiches and wraps were to eat at lunch. He found the food unappealing.\n\nHe witnessed other kids who were being “bad” getting yelled at and taken to the office for punishment. This made him feel uneasy and felt bad for these kids who he could hear still getting yelled at in the office. Overall he found some of the staff to be rude, mean and very strict to all the kids.\n\nI’m writing this for my son as he doesn’t want other kids to experience what he saw and went through and always says what a horrible place it was for him for that one year.  He never was one of the “bad kids” just the one witnessing how other troubled kids were treated and doesn’t feel like things were handled right.\n\nHe asked if we could give it 0 stars but unfortunately we can’t. It concerns me as a parent as he’s never been this strong about his feelings towards any of his previous daycares or after school programs.  This is why I wanted to share a review from a child’s perspective.",

We talked with him and discussed not using bad words. He would even tell his teacher he talked with us about it (as she told me)\nThey told me after the second time if it didn't stop they would have to take further action. I was in tears... how do I fix something I'm not seeing. The next day I got a call saying he swore and he's no longer welcome. I was floored... I payed for a month and there was a week left in the month. They said no he could not come back. When I tried to ask for help.. what can we do what are they doing I was given 0 help. Told that they told him not to do it and that was all. That's not how we help children... I was so disappointed in the lack of support from a place that takes care of my child while I'm trying to work.\nWhen we started a new daycare there was 0 swearing, however when the teacher would try to correct something he would jump and say please don't spank me.\n\nThis tells me there was some way more serious things happening at this daycare and I would very much NOT recommend you sending your child here.",

Not sure if standard in this industry but in 3.5 years my son had maybe 6 different teachers.\n\nThe dumpster-fire level of bad: the director, Crystal, is the most inept creature you will deal with. Always an excuse for everything instead of owning her mistakes, very limited communication on staff change (your kids will be handled by someone who didn’t introduce herself), and currently I’m fighting to get my deposit refund. The owner is not much better. 5 months later, I only got half of it without any explanation.\n\nIn short, Little Stars is great for your kids but you will not want to deal with its management.\n\nEDIT - The highly unprofessional answer from the owner says a lot. Trying to coerce their customers into removing their reviews and threaten legal action is not good business practice especially not when the review is not false.\n\nThat being said:\nI managed to recover my full deposit.\n4+ months of patience and good faith led me nowhere.

One important aspect for parents is the ability to rate daycare facilities, as it helps others make informed decisions. Since January, both of my children have been enrolled in their programs, and I am pleased to share that they are happy and even eager to attend daycare, even on weekends.\n\nHowever, recently I noticed many turnovers of teachers or staff members being reassigned to different classes. This has presented a challenge for the children, as they had already established a level of trust with their previous teachers. The previous teachers were familiar with the children's behaviours and had done an exceptional job providing care. Everything was running smoothly under their guidance.\n\nWith the introduction of new staff members may result in a transition period where they need time to adapt to their roles and responsibilities effectively. As a consequence, your child may encounter challenges in adjusting to these changes and may not receive the same level of consistent care as before. Despite this drawback, I want to emphasize that overall, this daycare is still great!",

I wasn’t provided with all the paperwork up front and all the questions I was asking would have been answered had she simply provided me with the parent handbook at the start, but I had to ask for it (once i found out one should exist, I didn’t even know there should have been one provided).

There was an instance when they lost a kid and then it was found by a stranger.Staff rotation is constant, seems like the management is bad. That shows in how cheap they are in everything: from getting kids supplies like diapers etc (which is often non existent) to what and when they feed them. There is no dedicated cook, the cook is supposed to divide their time between working alongside other teachers and preparing food/cleaning up duties. It results in terrible meal quality  and the feeding schedule theu provide DOES NOT  mix with reality. Just ask your kid. All the food is no name,low quality, watered down can soups etc etc. Stay away unless in absolute childcare emergency, don't be fooled by the fake professionalism outside and the good neighborhood",

They have a curriculum in place and we have seen our daughter grow in many ways. She looks forward to going to daycare. This was our first time dealing with a daycare and we are glad that it went smoothly. Highly recommend!",

I like that they use an app so I'm able to see my child's progress through the day and they also send msgs about the weekly lessons. This enables me to encourage more learning at home! :)\n\nOne big thing I notice is he doesn't get that sick compared to other kids I know in different daycare centres.

There are four major reasons why my family chose here after touring many daycare places. First, this place is located in a walk-out basement, which allows lots of sunlight in the classroom. Second, there is an amazing playground in the backyard; children may enjoy snow slide in Winter. Third, parents have an access to a CCTV camera in the classroom and can see their child anytime via their cell phone. This really attracted me because I am the person who is always worried about her child. But now I barely watch it because I realized there was not much to worry about. The last reason is that they provide healthy food for breakfast and lunch. I really appreciate the effort. Thank you Sojay, Ani and Young! :)",

Is the owners friends writing them?\nRead the 1 star reviews folks, whatever the 5 stars say couldn't possibly be enough to cover a missing 3 year old and several improper care warnings.\nI'm not sure why there aren't systems in place to stop the kids leaving by accident but the set up in our daycare means are kids never wandering off to the outside world.\nBuild a fence. Get a double door system. Basic childcare facilities have these in place for a reason. Totally unacceptable.",

The setting was very well organized and food was very nutritious. There were so many activities offered on a daily basis including outdoor walk (weather appropriate of course). One thing that really stood out for us was that this daycare used the \"dailyconnect app\" that updated our kid's activities, food intake ,etc, and shared his photos daily. I was very excited to check the app everyday to know what my boy was up to. Very impressive!\n\nOur boy loved this daycare so much. If we didn't move we would definitely continue to let our kid stay here. Highly recommend this daycare!",

I received a reply from \"Jane Jeanette\" asking for me to come in to the establishment to discuss the rates. I replied stating I would prefer finding out the rates prior to coming in because I have two children, one being a newborn.. I get a reply back from Jane again stating this:\n\n\"If I love my children, I will care about the place they will pass the day more than will care for the fees\"\n\nI called the daycare right away to try and speak with a manager or owner, there was no answer so I left a voicemail. Then I received a call right back from the daycare, and I asked if this was the person I was speaking to by email. She said yes. I asked if there was a manager at all, she said yes, I asked if she was the manager, and she said yes. I voiced my concerns stating how unprofessional that comment was and how she basically insinuated I don't love my children because I won't bring my immunocompromised child in to an establishment that could potentially have sick children. Obviously I was upset about the whole situation and ended the call. She called back right away to apologize for it stating she made a mistake and if I wanted to speak with the owner or manager I would need to come in to discuss it with them.i told her I was not coming in. I told her I would need to get their contact information which she refused to give because she flat out told me she doesn't want them to know about our encounter. She stated she was a volunteer and wasn't even an employee, and I asked her why she would say she was a manager then? She said the manager wasn't there so she is one. She basically kept telling me she wasn't going to let them know about the encounter and did not give me any contact information. I contstantly asked her name and she wouldn't give it to me.\n\nAbsolutely the worst experience I have ever encountered at a daycare. STAY AWAY!!!!!",

The school is run by compassionate and caring administrators and teachers who truly love what they do. It's no surprise there is very low teacher turnover.

The school admin forwarded my complaint to a teacher, other teachers/staff were not informed of my concern. My daughter's last day involved 4 girls bullying her class at recess again. My daughter tried to talk to Mr B. (teacher on duty) but he was dealing with another incident. Note that morning at 8:30 am I had emailed Ms. Massey (school administration) about a grade 3 students inappropriate behaviour upon us arriving at school. It took the school more than a day to return my email/call. Ms Massey claimed it was because she was researching the situation. Our conversation stopped when she denied that I had called in October. (I have an email from the school confirming my call).\n\nSuggest any parent review court documents regarding the school before making a commitment.",

Two of my children are currently attending this school and I don't have any negative things to say about it! They are thriving and doing so well. I truly appreciate the passion that the owner, Mrs. Debaar, put into this place. She truly cares about the children, the staff and the montessori way of life. It is a truly authentic montessori experience. I appreciate that there are many events that encourage the parents' involvements (ie. parent's night, afternoon tea, etc). The school also has special events like the Gala, Winter Wonderland, Family Picnic, etc. I also appreciate that my children barely gets sick from school! This is more of a preschool where kids are encouraged to be independent, self-directed, but also caring for one another. All the children must be potty-trained and bring their own lunches. I think this helps with lowering sicknesses and as well as the costs. I find this place very affordable in comparison to other daycares/preschools. It was more cost efficient to keep my eldest here for kindergarten full time than putting her in a halfday kindergarten and then paying additional costs for before & after school care. Overall, I only have good things to say about this school! It is a wonderful place to start buiding solid montessori foundations for the children.",

We've had a couple parent/teacher reviews since he started, and they have been able to supply feedback on how he's developing, adjusting to the environment, and learning. The staff are all very well trained to handle the children as well as teach in the Montessori way. Each classroom has at least 1 fully trained Montessorian, and ~3 other teachers to help with the kids. The kids know their routine and the day seems to progress smoothly. Throughout the year there are field trips, classroom events, school events, everything you would expect from a school. We have been very pleased with how our son has adapted and how he is developing and learning. The facility and materials are clean and well maintained. I'd love to send my daughter here when she gets old enough. Highly recommend.",

My kids are far more intelligent than other kids when they eventually started kindergarten. I still take my twin boys to their after school program. The teachers are awesome, very comforting and use gentle approach with the children. The daycare environment is very clean, tidy, and quiet. They teach the kids math,geography, arts, drawings, reading, and letters. I do not regret taking my kids to this daycare. I will definitely recommend this daycare to anyone 100%.

She is very strong willed and was very hard for her previous childcare to handle because she would act out, hitting and biting other children. Within a month of her transfer to MLC I could see a huge improvement. The owner of MLC is a huge part of learning plans and care of the children along with the teachers. She truly loves and takes care of every child that walks through the door. With a leader like that I can tell you that the whole school is the same way. They were amazing at communication and educating me along the way so I could be apart of my daughter journey.

My daughter has a gluten sensitivity and they have been very helpful in supporting this. I also appreciate that all children must bring vegetables or fresh fruit as snacks and once per month the children have a Montessori Meal and a fun storytelling & pizza day. I highly recommend any family to explore if Montessori is a fit for their child, and recommend this campus as the place to do it!",

        "text": "My eight year old attended Brightpath in Crescent Heights for several years as a toddler. So when looking for childcare for our daughter, Brightpath was a great place to start and the Springbank location was close to us. However we’ve had several concerning situations and actually withdrew our daughter from care there recently. The biggest concern is that our daughter broke her hand at the facility. Her hand is swollen, black and blue and now has a splint and XRay showing a break. The daycare is saying they have no idea at all what happened and everything was fine when she was there. It was very obvious when we picked her up she was in pain and she was very clearly telling us she hurt her hand. She can also show us exactly how it happened. The daycare refuses to write up any type of report as there is no evidence it happened at daycare - other than the child actually stating it did?! We removed her immediately. Our other concerns began about 6 months ago when she was moved at 2 into the 3-5 year old room and they don’t let children nap in that room. This seemed crazy and we went for weeks asking them to accommodate her napping. They would just say she’s not tired and they asked her to sleep in the chair in the room. It just seemed so ridiculous. I don’t recommend this Brightpath.",

The toddler program has had a noticeable impact on my youngest's concentration and behaviour - he will still be rambunctious, but at least he asks for permission before he makes a mess.  That said, being a skeptic of Montessori type environments I am now a convert to the style of learning.  It's not for every child, or parent for that matter, but it worked wonders for our children.  I really think it is the teachers that make a school, and the teachers here are outstanding.\n\nWe have since left the school (career reasons) and our children are well-prepared from their time at MCHA. More importantly, throughout the whole COVID-19 scenario we were apprized of the situation and when things opened up (w/ AHS restrictions) we reenrolled our youngest and to the best of their abilities Campus 1 and the wonderful/loving teachers were able to provide our son an island of joy and consistency in a world of turmoil and uncertainty.  We owe the wonderful folks at Campus 1 for doing such an incredible job in a very difficult time.\n\nThings were done right and we always knew our children were taken care of, always.",

        "text": "I have waited the better part of half a decade to write this review. Our son enrolled in MCHA as soon as he was able, and tomorrow will be his last day. This is what we can tell you about this place.\n\nFirst, the head directress is CRAZY. She is absolutely bonkers about child development and squeezing every ounce of performance out of your child. She has a knack for hiring knowledgeable and caring staff, and has created a very nurturing environment for children.\n\nIn the early years, they helped greatly in potty training our child. They provided a great structure daily which I believe set a great tone for our child.\n\nLater on, that structure translated to good habits. As the education continued, our child was challenged to do his best at every turn. He started kindergarten miles ahead of his classmates, which I accredit to MCHA. he was well adjusted to a classroom environment, made friends easily, and did not struggle at all with classroom style education.\n\nThey have many family events throughout the year, and in this way, helped our son form everlasting bonds with friends. Even we as parents have met friends! Examples include: grandparents tea, daddy day, mommy day, winter carnivals, year end galas, summer picnics, etc. These events really helped to create a feeling of family, and speaking to other friends who chose other childcare options, is super rare in the industry.\n\nWe went through COVID together. While COVID made everything crazy, killed businesses, and wreaked havoc, MCHA stayed an open, and implemented great policies. Of course, at the time I didn’t think this way , and disagreed and even argued with them. In hindsight, I can recognize where I might have had the wrong idea, and while they are a business, I truly believe they made decisions based firstly on the wellbeing of the children, with profit second or third in mind.\n\nChoosing MCHA was one of the best choices I have made for my son so far. If they ever open I private school, I would be all in!\n\nThey really are that good, and we will miss them as our son grows past this stage of his life.",

We love the curriculum and appreciate the nature walks, and outdoor classroom in the summer. Our son surprises every day with the new things he comes home with.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone seeking a pre-school!",

        "text": "My kiddo was at another daycare run by this company.  My child showed signs of trauma from being in their \"care\" for which we had to take her for testing, and two years on as a family we are Still experiencing the reprecussions and fall out of the confirmed trauma.  When I raised the issue with the owner I was contacted by someone out of this daycare who, although empathetic to my experience, was unable to get the owner to resolve the issue.  I took my concerns and anger from licensing all the way to my MLA at the time and the AB Justice Minister.  Turns out (because of legislation) licensing can't have a daycare shut down in Alberta as long as the daycare says they'll keep working on trying to do better.  Mount Royal Daycare has since been closed, is my understanding, although not sure the exact why.  In connecting with parents that also had their kids in the care of this company I have found my story and experience is not unique.  The staff will turn over and often are great with the kids (some are not).  Their hands, however, are tied by the behaviour and policies set out by the owners.  The website is beautiful and has really positive, buzworthy words.  If it hadn't been for my own family's horrific experience with this company and finding it was not unique or isolated, I would have thought this was a great place for my kiddo.  In summary, it was not safe and my trust was misplaced in them.",

The staff is very friendly and truly care for the children.  Paula, the daycare manager is very approachable and has a good understanding of how all the kids are doing.  There is a good combination of play variance, free play, strucuted play, arts & crafts, and physical activity.  They have also started a french program, and have learned sign language as well.  My only complaint is that I wish there was more email communication about staff changes and monthly meal plans, but with that said they do post all of that information in the daycare, so its really more of a suggestion than a complaint.\nThis daycare embraces all cultures, and multi-language families, which is something we really love.\nAnytime there has been a notable injury, we have been notified via a formal form the staff fills out outlining the series of events, but nothing major has ever happened.  The kids get in scuffles all the time, but nothing more than normal kid stuff.\nOverall, we are very happy with this childcare centre and would recommend it!",

There is plenty of outdoor space and the setup feels like a home away from home. After moving our kids from another daycare, they were more settled in here in a few days than they were after a few months at the previous place. When we pick them up at the end of the day their teachers have so many updates and you can really tell they genuinely care about our little ones. The class sizes are nice and small, and the activities are open-ended and fun. Our 3 year old comes home so excited to tell us all about her day, and our 1 year old settles into the arms of her teachers just like she does with mom and dad at home. What a relief it is to find a daycare like this for the most important little people in our lives.",

We liked the smaller size of this daycare compared to other ones in the area as it feels cozy like a day home with the service of a proper center. The staff have been wonderful in both nurturing and teaching our child things we as parents couldnt possibly think of. The staff are both professional and reliable which are qualities you search for when making the decision to leave your child in someone elses care. The center is very clean and tidy which is a miracle because my human is a single handed personal tornado and there are oodles of children being children in there! The owner Janet and director Andrea are very responsive to the needs of parents and are in regular communication with families about center updates. The staff are absolutely passionate about caring for children and it's such a relief to see your child run into the class each day with a quick \"bye mommy\" vs the dreaded cling and cry (which by the way are also handled so well by the teachers...makes for less tears for us parents too!)\nHands down come take a look at NBCC. We love it there.",

I agreed with one of the parents who left a review 4 years ago and said\" They were unwilling to address concerns and flat out ignore emails if it was not positive\". The owner does not care if you email your concerns to her. You will never see her btw. The whole place is run by the director (who is actually another staff with a title but no power). If you have a complaint, it will go nowhere. I think management is a huge issue in this place. The care taker are hit and missed. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. One has so much attitude towards parents. They prefer taking their time to write down your kid's arrival time to opening the door to you while it is a snow storm outside. My kid was there for 6 months, we saw more than 7 different staff there.\n-They also take 1st month child care fee and the last month fee right off the bet ($1545 +1545 =$3090)\n-They need you to give two months notice if you wanted to switch day care (once you are in, you are stuck forever!!!)\n-Their building is old and falling apart (it was so hot this summer, 25 to 29 degrees and above; one teacher/care taker told me the A/C is not working properly)\n-The whole place has no structure; staff is not trained and just put there to work.\n-With the government subsidies, they have a 3% cap to increase price yearly (so they will increase that probably every year as they already did and explained this year, the increment is to cover their loss during the pandemic)\nI think this place take expensive fees and not delivering the standard and services that it should be. There are lots of child care centers out there that take the same price and give a much better service!!!",

        "text": "Two years ago, we moved to Calgary. There were too much to say. We send out little one to a family daycare at beginning. It turns out to be a disaster. We then have to hire a nanny to take care him until he was 3 years old. Then we send him to a daycare which doesn't provide lunch, and the two childcare givers need to care kids from age 3 to 5. It turns out they do not care about kids that much, it is just a job. We then moved our kids to panda daycare. My little one was 3 and half at that time. We were so happy to have him there. The teachers are really care for the kids. We mentioned our little one's weight is out of chart, hope they can give him more time to eat. They were very happy to help, and provide good solution to let him eat longer. We had mentioned the same problem to other daycare, their response is that they need take care so many kids, not just our little one! Other good part about this daycare is that they provide a lot great programs for kids. Music teacher comes 3 times a week, kids fitness lesson once per week with a small fee, a lot of field trips, many interesting things to do, such as baking, art craft etc. The most important thing is that the teachers are very nice, considerable and negotiable!! Plus this daycare provide breakfast, lunch and snack. It saved me a lot of time.  We definitely love Panda.",

I was told that they were unable to reach Darrel, as he was on vacation, and that no tour would be provided. This was completely unprofessional conduct. If they were not providing tours due to the outbreak, they should have contacted any viewings to inform us prior to arrival for two reasons: 1. I would not have attended a facility with a GI outbreak to protect my daughter from potentially getting ill as a result of my attending the facility and 2. Wasting our time to turn us away at the door was very poor business. This should have been done in advance. Thankfully, this has certainly narrowed down our search options, as we will never send our daughter to such a facility.",

The director is AMAZING and although my kids miss her in class they still feel like they see her and get to interact with her! She ALWAYS makes time to listen to any concern I may have about my kids and goes out of her way to help me. I’ve seen her do this with other parents also! Sure truly has the kids in her heart and wants what’s best For them! My kids couldn’t love going to “school” any more then they do and after the weekend are so very thrilled to see their teachers again! Thank you so much to ALL of the staff at this location for helping a mama to know that my kids are loved and cared for while not in my care you all are rockstars!

My wife and I looked at several day cares before visiting Panda, and I immediately got a great vibe when we walked in Panda’s door. That vibe was more than fulfilled. You can see it in everything that transpires at Panda - the staff, from the director to the teachers to the kitchen staff, all love children. I will fully admit I approached the whole concept of daycare with trepidation, but any doubts I had were completely erased by this wonderful place.\n\nThe way my daughter’s face lights up when she sees her teachers is so heartwarming. The HiMama app the staff use shows what your child is doing throughout the day, and I would definitely say they are having a blast. They sing songs, play with an incredible variety of toys, get plenty of outdoor time when the weather permits, and just generally have fun. The kitchen staff always have a delicious and healthy variety of meals and snacks to serve, even for picky children. My daughter typically naps very well, because the staff do such an amazing job making sure they have a good time!\n\nAgain, I cannot emphasize enough the warmth, dedication and compassion I see from all the staff there, and they do it every day, eight hours a day, five days a week. They’re so accommodating. My daughter benefits from Panda so significantly, and I feel truly fortunate she is looked after by such lovely people.",

Our older daughter has been there for 3.5 years and our younger one just started a few months ago.\nI am so impressed and grateful everyday for this daycare and the staff that make it the exceptional place that it is for the kids. I feel so good about dropping them off there everyday and have no worries or anxiety about the care they are receiving because I know it is excellent. The staff are so caring, patient and loving, always have the best interest of the kids in mind and welcome them in the mornings with open arms and big smiles. Both my kids love going there and are always excited about it. They both absolutely love their teachers, which to me means they are treated very well. Any of my concerns regarding the kids are always taken seriously by the director and the teachers. We get many updates and pictures/videos throughout the day regarding how and what the kids are doing and even details like their mood and how long they napped.\nBefore we decided on a daycare, we looked at A LOT of different ones and there was always something about each one that I did not feel right about. But after viewing Panda I felt so good and excited about it because there was not even one thing that made me concerned or uncomfortable. I still feel this way 3.5 years later. It is clean, it is safe, it is fun, it is a loving environment, staff genuinely care, and staff are highly educated and knowledgeable in childcare. My kids learn so much and have a lot of fun because the teachers plan the activities and learning around what they see are the children's interests.\nI also really love how they make it a priority to take the kids outside to play once or twice a day (weather depending of course), because we think getting outside is so beneficial. The outdoor play areas are very nice, safe and age appropriate. The food they serve the kids is exciting to them while still being healthy and including all food groups.\nThere are just so many great things I could say about the Ranchlands Panda Daycare and I have no complaints. We are so appreciative to all the great staff and all their hard work and care every single day. Thank you a million times to them!",

As an example of Panda staff going above and beyond for our daughter: we usually hold her until she falls asleep, and the staff here held her for all her naps (although she needs this less, now!)\n\nOur daughter also has difficulty transitioning away from being home every day, and was often only happy when being held. So the staff at Panda held her almost all day.\n\nNow, our daughter is thriving. She rarely needs to be held during the day or during naps, and last week, she didn't even watch me leave as she was so interested in what was going on in the room.\n\nThe staff here are amazing. We have confidence leaving our daughter in their capable care.\n\n*Update: after a full year, we continue to be blown away by the great care our daughter receives from the staff here. I recommend Panda to anyone, without reservation. Your child will be well cared for here.\n\nUpdate 2: another year later, and we still have no complaints. Baby #2 is also here, now. Great, clean space. Great programming. And most importantly, staff we have confidence trusting our children with.",

The camp was led by Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan, whose dedication to education and attention to detail truly set the tone for an exceptional learning environment.\n\nFrom the very beginning, it was evident that Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan were not just instructors, but passionate educators who genuinely cared about each child's growth and development. Their enthusiasm for education was contagious, making every class engaging and exciting for both myself and my child.\n\nOne of the remarkable aspects of the camp was the attention to detail in designing each class. The curriculum was thoughtfully structured to balance learning and enjoyment, ensuring that the children not only had fun but also gained valuable knowledge in every session. This approach created a perfect blend of entertainment and education that kept both kids and parents excited about each day of the camp.\n\nWhat truly made the experience special was the personal touch that Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan brought to their interactions with the children. Their ability to connect with each student on an individual level fostered a positive and encouraging atmosphere. This personalized approach helped my child feel valued and motivated to actively participate and learn.\n\nThe only minor area that could use some improvement was the cleanliness of the school floor. I noticed that on a daily basis, when my child returned home, his socks were quite dirty and covered in dust. Perhaps a bit more attention to maintaining the cleanliness of the floors could enhance the overall experience, ensuring that the learning environment remains as exceptional as the educational content.\n\nOverall, the summer camp at Renert School was a truly outstanding experience. Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan's dedication to education, attention to detail, and genuine enthusiasm created an environment where learning was not only enjoyable but also deeply rewarding. Both myself and my child left the camp with a sense of accomplishment and a desire to continue exploring new horizons in education. I would wholeheartedly recommend Renert School's programs to anyone seeking a meaningful and enriching educational experience for their children.",

        "text": "I'm currently a student at this school, and I love it! I just want to share my experience with those considering attending this school. However, since I am in junior high, I can't attest to other grades.\n\nTL;DR: The teachers are knowledgeable, and the school considers each student's abilities and puts them into certain classes that allow them to move at their own pace. The school also provides students with the freedom to choose some of their courses. However, there should be more communication between the administration and students, and there is a lot of homework.\nQuality of education: 10/10\nTeachers: 9/10\nSocial life: 7/10\nQuality of location: 10/10\n\nMost teachers, as not everyone can be perfect, are awesome and teach well, and are very knowledgeable in their area. I am excited to learn something new every time I go to class, and have had several in depth conversations with teachers. I also need to mention that in subjects like math and English, students are put in certain classes by their level of understanding, allowing students to move at their own pace. This has allowed me to move forward, and I am glad that the school takes each student's needs into consideration.\n\nI love the choice this school provides, with \"electives\" and \"Choice Friday\". Electives are like mini courses that different teachers offer, and students get to choose which ones they go to. While Choice Friday is when the entire Friday is filled with classes of the students' choice. These courses have allowed me to discover my interests, and it gives something to look forward to everyday. The school also provides a variety of clubs to join.\n\nNow, I want to talk a bit about the social life. The school does set up some events for students to hang out, such as school dances. Also, many students opt to spend time together in the cafeteria after classes end, so there is an active social life.\n\nHowever, I will now mention some negatives to give a weighted review. I think that there needs to be more communication between the administration and students, so students can provide feedback to the school. Also, keep in mind, especially if you are in junior high or high school, there will be a lot of homework that you will need to juggle. I know that I struggle with managing my time to get everything done.",

Speaking from experience, this really helps to make learning fun and more personal than any other school I’ve been to. Class sizes are small which allows each student to connect with their teachers in ways that other larger schools don’t allow. Their motto of “Serious Fun” could not be more accurate to the design of the school. The school helps each and every student achieve success in a matter that is both engaging and fun. Renert is a dream school that has helped me and many other students in so many ways. I am incredibly grateful for all the staff at Renert for all they do and I cannot recommend this school enough.",

Shortly after, she harshly grabbed two other boys in an aggressive way because they were just playing in the clothing racks at the front.

I had started the hunt for the right day care early on as we had a cow milk protein allergy and wanted to find a place we were felt comfortable and confident it wouldn't be overlooked. We toured many in the central NW/NE area and after meeting with Janelle, they were the obvious choice. The owner operator has children herself that attend the daycare so we felt that the standards must be upheld to a strong degree. The teachers rotate among the classes so even though we don't get to become as familiar with a select few, they are all very friendly. Communication is through the common himama app, which is easy to use and we have been happy with the response rate. We get lots of photo updates throughout the day, a mood update and the daily report at the end of the day. Jess, the program director, is approachable and friendly. As new parents we had tons of questions and concerns in the first few months and Jess has always been informative and accommodating! The parking lot is a bit weird to get out of, especially during busy times. As long as you have a back up camera, it's all good! The location next to a bottle Depot and in an industrial area may be off-putting for some, but I recommend to take a tour with Janelle first before passing them over  We chose them over the big name franchise daycares and we are happy with our choice.",

I WANNA SAY EVERY BAD REVIEW IS SAYING “ SCAM AND NOT OUR CLIENT “” but I can name all the staff members including the director so I hope they don’t say that in this review. I sent my daughter to this daycare as we had not many choices as we recently moved to the area and upon registration I verified if there are going to be daily reports of how kids do and how their day was which is a normal process of a daycare !! They made me download their app as well When I didn’t get any report for few days nothing at all as a parent and joining new daycare I asked them how I am not getting any reports and I got reply back that I should be getting it and when I asked few times about daily reports as I was expecting it itself and one day my daughter mentioned it how one of the teacher was bit rude to her and she didn’t want to go to school so I called and spoke to the staff but they said nothing happened like that at all and then few days later director called me when I went to pick up my daughter. She said my daughter lies in her class  no one want to be friends with her and if she continues then she will become a bully ????? Like she was talking about a 4 years old child ??? What kind of director or daycare is that ? And then I was told that why I am keep asking for daily reports as they feel that I DON’T  TRUST THEM ?? AS a matter of fact your own staff promised me something and later on to cover your mistakes they started pointing fingers at us and my child ( keeping in mind , my child is only 4 years old ) and I was told by the director that  after 3 years old they treat the child as an Adult ??? Wow I was really shocked with all these statements. I was told if I don’t trust them I can terminate the same day ? Like I need to find new place as a working parent. I felt completely lost with what was it all about and next day they day when I went to pick her up director said my daughter was really good today ? Like how. I didn’t say anything to her and why would I  !! I would never recommend this school to anyone. Whenever I went to pick up my child   Kids every time would keep hugging her and embrace my daughter with love.  It was completely lie that how I was told that children do not like to play with her. Director was the one of the rudest individuals I met and her comments were completely unprofessional, she said which daycare does daily reports ? I immediately started looking for new school and found it. Had to quit in couple months. Would never recommend this place.",

        "text": "We did a mistake by not checking the reviews for this day care before sending our child there. Our kid was diagnosed with ASD last year and this daycare collaborates with PUFF to provide care for ASD diagnosed kids. Apparently that’s only for show! Our kid was always hungry there inspite of the fact that we used to send food for her everyday. Daycare was adamant about sending child in the morning before 8 and then if you come to pick her up around 1-2 they had problem stating that it’s the time when kids are sleeping. When we used to pick her around 3, she used to be really tired, sleepy and cranky (for obvious reason because she was hungry). If we tried to drop child at around 12, then their head Gazala would come off really rude stating ‘we are not going to accept child at this hour’!!! It’s a daycare, not school. You don’t feed our child so it’s difficult for us to leave our child for 6-8 hours there without food! Parents drop kids at daycare according to the convenient times based on their jobs. We still adjusted with them since we needed daycare for her. And teachers were not even compassionate with kids. And in mid February one day when my husband was picking up our daughter, Gazala came in to state ‘we are not going to accept your child from march!’ On asking why, said said “she has meltdowns, she is difficult to look after that’s why”. When I went in to talk to her she said “I have to put in another person to look after her which costs me one extra person’s salary so I cannot have your child!” Are you kidding me!!!! When talking to PUFF coordinator she confirmed there was no change in meltdowns or aggression in our child. Confronting Gazala with the same she stated “I don’t know why she said that but we can’t have her” I asked “why do you collaborate with PUFF, there is no point. Why force us to leave her at 8? How you can tell us not to send her after 2 weeks without giving us enough notice to find a place good enough for her? “ Absolutely no answer except “we can’t have her, I can’t pay another person to look after her”!!! You can’t be serious! Why even bother to have a daycare when you can’t support child, when you or the teachers don’t feel compassion for kids, why even be in this profession. My child’s care is just a business profit for you that you are stating it will cost her more! Absolutely ridiculous behaviour, no parent should ever be sending their child to this horrible place!",

        "text": "Our daughter has been with Seedlings for the last two years. I highly recommend this school to anyone interested in the Spanish language (or really anyone looking for caring, responsive care for their children).\n\nWe’ve found the teachers to be kind, nurturing, thoughtful, and very capable. The staff-to-student ratios are ideal for small group learning and ensuring our daughter gets plenty of one-on-one attention. We appreciate the art portfolios and progress reports that the school provides. We also love the HiMama app. It simplifies communication with the school and teacher, and we love the daily photos and videos. Thanks to Miss Yenni, Miss Imi, Miss Sonia, Miss Gina, and all of the other wonderful teachers and staff!\n\nSeedlings sounds like a great school and program, but we were ultimately drawn to them after visiting the school in person. The classroom is carefully laid out so everything is accessible and welcoming to young children. It's warm, inviting, and full of the children's projects from throughout the year. It felt like the kind of place we would want to be ourselves, if we were children.\n\nSeedlings is Reggio-based, but aspects of Montessori that we were drawn to: a child-led approach, carefully prepared environment, the teacher as a guide, and mixed-age classrooms, were better represented in Seedlings than in any other school we visited.\n\nWhile neither parent speaks Spanish, our daughter comes home singing Spanish songs and surprising us with her comprehension of Spanish children’s books we pick up at the library. It’s clear that the way Spanish-learning is facilitated here is immersive, fun, and memorable for her.\n\nThe variety of activities and creative work the students do on a daily basis is fantastic. The children get plenty of outdoor time, with a variety of nearby options for outings (and a large, indoor gym space for smoky days). Our kiddo particularly loves yoga and water fun days. The teachers have also done a wonderful job putting together the children's end-of-year and Christmas concerts. We're so grateful to have found Seedlings!",

My two kids (age 4 and 2) are attending the bilingual program at the Downtown - Scarboro location, and I couldn't be happier with our choice.\n\nWhy do I recommend this daycare:\n1. Outstanding teachers - supportive, enthusiastic and genuinely caring teachers make this daycare a real gem.\n2. Excellent curriculum - daily Spanish, music, art and science (experiments) classes. They also have a big gym space, which is particularly useful for physical activities during our long winters.\n3. Small group sizes - lots of one-on-one time helps create a stronger bond between teachers and children, making the children feel safe. It also helps to develop friendships.\n4. Mixed-age groups - one of the reasons I initially decided on this daycare. I wanted my children to participate in the same program and grow together. They will have continuity of care and go through fewer transitions from caregiver to caregiver. I've noticed older children being very nurturing toward my younger child, and she learns a lot from her older peers. They support each other.\n\nMy kids truly love their teachers. Thank you, Miss April and Miss Gina, and other teachers at the Scarboro location, for taking such wonderful care of my kids!",

She has also cultivated an affinity for crafting that clearly has been fostered in this amazing program.

        "text": "Not impressive at all!  A person would walk in and love what they see.  A Good Earth to the right promises caffeine while you wait in line, a large library just past that promising more dreams to be discovered. The bird's nest dropping from the ceiling above you while the cranes fly towards it.  It looks so magical.\n\nThen you get to the counter to pay for your way in.  It's $18.50 and it takes at least 10 minutes to get you in.  They have to know everything about you and not just what you want to go do there.  It's a recreation center, not a police department!   So after finally getting in, I go to the locker rooms, and discover that the lockers are not secure.  You have to provide your own lock.  You can get one there but you have to spend and extra $20 for it. You end up taking your valuables with you to the pool.\n\nTheir waterpark seems okay.  Sadly, the waterslides were apparently closed and you had to wait for a hour before a person can get to enjoy them.  But that's okay because that flowrider is calling your name.  It is an indoor surf-pool that you get to ride on and it is not a gentle ride either.  Quite frankly, it kicks you around like an old hacky sack.  It really is thrilling and fun.  Worth the thirty minute wait.  That is the first star.\n\nHowever, you have to sign a waiver that isn't there and was not mentioned to you when you paid the fee.  However, one saving grace is this wonderful lifeguard named Ella who actually helped you fill one out on your phone and still watches you valuables for you while to try this place out.  She is the only reason why this place is getting a second star.\n\nThe rest is not good.  When questions were asked to other lifeguards and they did not know the answers to anything.  Not so great!  The lazy pool was clearly made by lazy people.  It looks so small and uninspired.  All you do is walk in a flowing circle.  The hot tubs were tepid at best.  You can feel yourself shivering still.  The sauna was alright but the air feels the same as the pool, choleric and not altogether pleasant.  Lastly, everything was closed.  Diving boards, waterslides (that did not open an hour later), and who knows what else were not open.\n\nThere needs to be some serious changes and not just to these odd schedules but the customer service is atrocious.  Customers are not made aware of any waivers, the staff does not know what is going on with their equipment or environment, and on top of that, not too many people were that friendly or approachable.  Please do better with this and take a few notes from Ella who was actually the one helpful person.\n\nFor $18.50 you can make this a place where everyone feels welcome, has fun, and everything is in working order.  Some of us have spent less money to go into a pool/waterpark and have had some great times.  Please do better!",

They are professional, committed to adhering to the many policies and procedures required for accreditation, but most of all, they are so loving to our boys!\n\nWhen my sensitive eldest son was struggling with the change in transitioning from the Baby room to the Toddler room, every teacher in the Centre was rooting for his success and helped to make the transition as easy as possible.  Even those teachers not involved with the rooms in question would let us know \"he's doing so much better\" and \"he's doing great\".  It made such a difference for us to know that everyone was on his side and watching out for him.  With the care and encouragement of the preschool teachers, he has blossomed from a shy boy who would not participate in organized activities/arts & crafts to an outgoing participant in all things - I give them so much credit for this transition.\n\nThe staff genuinely care about the kids in the Centre - they get to know each child's little personality quirks, interests and skills and enjoy drawing them out and celebrating them.  They also understand each child's individual challenges and help to support them through these.\n\nWhen we drop our children off each day, I am confident they are in a safe, caring environment where they will be supported, loved and have lots of fun - there is always something new going on!",

Loved the waterslide, and wave pool.  Also a nice deep hot tub which is a good size.  The only things I would suggest is spending more time cleaning the outside.

I went straight to the gym and my husband went with our daughter. He dropped her off and I remained in the building while he left. After 5'-10' I received a call, a voice that was asking me where am I exactly 'cause she has to come to \"check on me\". I could not believe it, say what? You have no authority, what checking means to you?! She is my child and I know what responsibility means. If I bring her couple of times per week that doesn't mean  I need someone to come and check me, it means that you have a job and I get to go to the gym, end of story. It's unbelievable, I don't know who hired these people but I won't accept that kind of behaviour, never! Long story short we took our daughter out and that was it.

I was given a one week free pass and then two additional day passes to cover the gap for my 65th birthday in a few days.  I'll be joining as a full 'senior' member on my birthday.  I look forward to signing up for the deep water exercise program.  The swimming lanes and competition hot pool are fantastic!!!!",

The facility exceeded all my expectations, and it's easily one of the best aquatic centers I've ever visited.\n\nThe pool area was clean, spacious, and well-maintained, creating a welcoming environment for visitors of all ages. The water temperature was just right, making it comfortable for swimming, splashing, and playing around. The variety of pools catered to different preferences, from the fun-filled leisure pool with water features to the lap pool for serious swimmers.\n\nThe water slides were a highlight of the experience! It felt like a mini water park with thrilling slides that both kids and adults enjoyed. The lifeguards were attentive and made sure everyone followed safety guidelines, which added to the overall peace of mind.\n\nI appreciated the ample seating and lounging areas around the pool, providing a perfect spot to relax and soak up some sun between swims. The entire facility had a friendly and family-oriented atmosphere, making it a great place for a day of fun with loved ones.\n\nAdditionally, the changing rooms and amenities were clean and well-equipped, making it easy to freshen up after a swim.\n\nOverall, Shane Homes YMCA at Rocky Ridge's swimming pool is a top-notch aquatic destination in Calgary. Whether you're a water enthusiast or just looking for a fun day out, I highly recommend this place for an enjoyable and refreshing experience.",

There are grown men going into the universal washroom where it’s meant for you and your family to go and change but there’s grown men whose lockers are beside young children and that are changing there. There are no doors separating the washrooms between the men, women, and universal changing rooms there is just one big door that is open for everyone to see. The pool itself is very unsanitary and there are loads of chlorine that are unsafe and health risking for those who have serious health problems and including pregnant women. The drains were full of hair, dirt and skin! The hot tub was cloudy and brown. The lack of cleanliness is leading to the drains to become clogged and build a great amount of dirt and debris which could cause many people to become extremely sick. I would not recommend this place to take your kids to swim. The gym itself is nice but is it really clean?!?",

My kids were exposed to many different experiences, activities, and field trips (both in school and off site). They had many opportunities to walk to the ravine near the school and learn from nature. The classroom built on many of the foundational skills necessary to prepare them for kindergarten based on each child’s readiness level in a pressure free environment. I also had lots of opportunities to volunteer in the classroom. Both my kids absolutely loved the teachers and their first experience and exposure to a school setting.

Multiple activities, such as pysanka decoration, baking, field trips were planned throughout the year. St Nicholas Concert, Mother’s Day Tea and Family Fun Night were some of the annual events that both children and parents looked forward to.\nSadochok truly helped my son successfully prepare for kindergarten, as well as learn the Ukrainian language, culture and traditions.

My daughter began to talk better, eat better and overall her development progressed a lot since we started going Sadochok. I love that every day my daughter brings some crafts (unique each time). They have a piano teacher who plays music every day. Kids love music and they are taught how to sing in both English and Ukrainian.\n\nMy daughter is a poor eater, she doesn't want to eat at home, but she always eats at Sadocohok. Teachers feed them. Kids play outside every day. The place is very clean, no issues at all.\n\nI would never trust anyone else to take care of my daughter. I'm confident that she is in great hands and she is safe. Thank you, Sadochok, for being a great place for every child. My daughter loves your childcare, and I don't think there is a better recognition than when my daughter wakes up every day and wants to go to Sadochok. HUGE THANK YOU!",

Sadochok encourages learning with daily routines and activities ranging from puzzles, to early math and reading / writing skills and even baking / cooking for special events.\nSadochok has an ability to embrace learning through play and allows kids to develop independence, pride and ability to tackle any task.  Teachers have phenomenal style that our son truly benefited from, we are more than sure that all of the kids did. It was very easy for us to notice what an amazing learning environment Sadochok has created for all the kids. Sadochok provides a safe environment for children to explore their work and socialize with other kids, but also provides an age appropriate curriculum for the preschool aged children. The techniques are extremely effective, yet firm manner, produces amazing results with the kids. It was easy to notice, that our son was performing tasks way beyond what his friends of the same age were doing at other daycare facilities and it was the key for him to successfully transition into public kindergarten. Sadochok not only teaches kids the skills necessary to perform, but it provides kids with the confidence and discipline to achieve success.  We truly believe that if we had more preschools similar to Sadochok, our children would be better prepared for school and have a better start and more success in our education system.\nThank you Sadochok for the hard work and unique style of teaching kids how to start their life adventure!  Truly wish every family has the same opportunity as we had!\n\nKind regards,\nIryna and Kevin G.",

I will try to be objective as much as possible.\nThe facility where the daycare is located is rented out for social functions such as weddings and parties over the weekends or in summer time. After all, you do not have to go any further than to read some of the comments from individuals who rented the premises.\n\nThe daycare itself is located at the church basement with little or no daylight.\n\nIn the late fall of 2016 when I came to bring my child I saw daycare workers cleaning up the mess that was left by renters who rented the premises over the weekend!  The hall was rented by Bulgarian community  members tho just had too much alcohol and were unable to control themselves.  I have nothing against Bulgarian community at all, but I am just basing my statement on what the daycare workers said to me.\n\nAs I discovered that day,  my daughters' shoes were missing and were nowhere to be found. Her clothing was all over the place. In addition there was broken furniture that the daycare workers were trying to fix. The place was dirty. The janitor The  daycare workers were trying to do the damage control by saying that there was nothing wrong and that the problems will be taken care of.\nThe next day the premises were cleaned up and looked OK, however I have a problem having children staying in the bar or place where alcohol is consumed and who knows what kind of drunks who may be carrying all sorts of diseases attended.\nMy older daughter was infected with wart and we still have problem having it cured to this day.\nLastly, I also saw that the daycare workers were working while having flu and were very sick. On a few occasions there were only a a few children at the daycare as many of them were became infected with flu.\n\nIn 2016 this daycare had problems attracting new children to attend. The quality of education is not bad, but what is the point of having educated but sick children?\n\nThese are the things that I personally witnessed. I want the facts to speak for themselves.\nI would like to have the reader to arrive with his/her own conclusions.",

During the year and a half that we were there, lots of staff moved around, and/or left the organization. They went through five managers during the time we were there and often we were given conflicting information from one to the next. Once my son started exhibiting signs of emotional dysregulation related to his ADHD, we had 1 in person meeting, he was suspended 2 weeks later (he was part-time and had only attended 3 days within that two week period). He was 4 years old and we were told he couldn't come back until he had an aide for one-on-one care. I wasn't able to hire someone myself, they would not hire without funding, and told me it was too difficult for them to hire someone at that time. I was able to get some emergency support through Providence and they worked with Summit to determine a re-entry plan that was only a few hours a couple times a week. A few days before he was to restart, they emailed me to say they changed their mind. I wrote to complain and asked for the CEO Nancy Klensch to call me, but she never bothered (or was never told?). So not a great place for neurodiverse kids unless you already have funding in place for additional help.",

        "text": "We are happy to put Sunvalley behind us and put our child in school where there is consistency, with the teachers not changing every month and receiving proper communication from the staff.  Our experience with this centre started out great in 2021 but once the director in 2021 left and all the good teachers were forced out, it declined rapidly and continues to do so.  Coming to pick my child up and seeing the daily chaos in the classroom that was so dysfunctional was hard to witness.  We had several incidents with other children and was told that a solution would be forthcoming of a quiet space for kids to go to calm down when they needed a time out and as soon as it was implemented in the form of a tent it was removed and put elsewhere as the children used it as a hang out.  No other solution was ever put forward or communicated.  I also worried for the safety of the children as the front door hasn't locked let alone closed properly for the last month or more of our time there and no one seemed to have any urgency to fix it.  I mentioned it several times to staff and the director without much concern or action from anyone.  My child was napped until 4 1/2 years old despite my CONSTANT pleading with the director and the staff to stop as I (along with many other parents) stating that my child hasn't napped since 3 years old like most children and was told constantly it was for her benefit and that she wanted too.  Of course she wanted too she was being told too...! This caused much regression at home and made bedtime a struggle most nights.  I communicated our frustrations and wishes to the director who always compared her younger child to mine and said \"well my child still naps and sometimes they just need it\".  I got no where.\nThey rarely did any crafts which is very sad for a pre-kindergarten program and when you are paying the annual material fee it is very disappointing.  All that would be ever sent home is a small scrap piece of paper with some colouring on it or a photocopied colouring picture that she had done sometimes 3-4 times already in the classroom. Needless to say my child was very bored with the lack of stimulation.  Before the decline in the centre's staff the previous teacher that was in the pre-school room (before she was forced to resign) did the most creative crafts with the kids almost everyday and was so in-tune with what was going on, and the kids were so excited to attend class each day.  She would send many pictures and updates on the app per day regarding your child and now you are lucky to get a single picture during the week and most of the time it is of another child.\nLastly, the one event that my child was looking forward too was pre-k graduation as she had participated in the previous year.  I asked the director and staff regularly at the end of May and into June if it was going to happen on the date specified on the centre's calendar (June 23) and was told repeatedly that they hadn't thought about it and was told it might happen on a Friday night or a Saturday in July but they didnt know. Nonetheless, we were emailed this Monday and told that it is scheduled for this Friday night and all families are being charged for the use of the gown.  This is so disheartening to know that we were given only 4 days notice and most families will not be given the opportunity to attend due to busy summer schedules and children that have already left the centre as noted previously.  Dispite reaching out to the director she never addressed my concerns or lack of notice and planning.\nIt is very upsetting when I look back that the centre is considered Montessori but don't adhere to most of the requirements with little to no structure.  I do not recommend this centre and didn't move my child simply because of the great friends we made.  Childcare is no joke and should be taken very seriously.  We are entrusting you with our children and you should be ensuring their growth, development and most importantly safety each and everyday.  Which they have failed to do. They have alot of work to do.",

The daycare price here is quite cheaper compared to the previous one and after few visits of this centre, we were convinced to give a shot. So far, we are happy of this move. The transition was super smooth and it's like nothing really changed in his life. The team there takes good care of our boy and one of the best part is that we receive several pictures and/or videos on a daily basis through the app! That's great! The most important is that our boy seems happy over there (when you see him running towards the teachers after just a few weeks of attendance ... it's generally a good sign). Keep up the good work AND the reasonable price. Thanks.",

They are patient and passionate, and greet every child with a joy-full smile and a warm welcome.\n\nWhen asked to describe Child's Way, our daughters, years after, said they were, \"kind and generous\", \"nice to everybody\", and \"they love me and cared [about] me!\" ",

The staff is absolute top tier, even starting to teach her spanish when she said she wanted to learn it!    Also the food they serve the kids is literally the best I've seen in 16 years of having kids in daycare.    They were also gracious enough to adapt to my bonkers work schedule, which made my life way easier!     Their rates were very competitive, even being lower than other top tier centers.    They did have a bit of an issue when they switched to a new accounting system but it was handled quickly.

I can't express enough my gratitude towards every employee, teachers, chef and students. We are so thankful we've found this place and will recommend to all our friends and family. They are so caring and attentive the each kid's needs. It is simply beautiful to see. It is already so hard to let your kid go to daycare and I feel like everyone at the Learning Child Academy has made the process so much easier, put me and my husband at ease to send her to daycare knowing she was surrounded by such wonderful humans. THANK YOU!",

Coming from our previous childcare being a dayhome setting, I was nervous about the transition and the experience we would have at a larger centre, but I have been continually impressed by TLCMA.  The teachers care so much about the kids, and our children have developed a strong bond with many of the teachers and many of the other students.\n\nThis school is welcoming, clean, filled with  teachers who are simply happy and genuine people.  I have watched the programs grow, and they are building not only a strong school setting, but a sense of community for the families who attend here.\n\nThroughout the summer, there has been many really fun activities for the children, and we are looking forward to getting back into the regular curriculum and watching our little ones' minds grow.  Montessori has provided our children a great sense of independence and has helped us grow as parents as well.",

When we moved to Dover I was concerned about the new Daycare which is more affrodable than any other program I have ever heard of and does not use the Montessori model.\nMy daughter has been attending for more than two years now and has learned more and become better adjusted than any of the time she spent in her prior program. The children are always provided with activities that fit their interest and are not regelated to one paticular activity or subject, which sounds like it would be chaos, but it is the furthest thing from it! The teachers and leaders are adept at keeping the children engaged and participating with appropriate behaviour. The kids learn how to navigate relationships in an age appropriate manner while doing everything else.\nI LOVE Thornhill Dover and I hope my daughter gets to stay until she ages out.",

We have had outstanding experiences with the school so far. The staff are caring and nurturing, and it is a very comfortable environment to leave your child. One time I was there during pick-up and my daughter had a little trip and fall and she went to her teacher for a hug even though I was there (which is a good sign to me!). They provide a good balance of structured activities and free time, with lots of age-appropriate and stimulating learning experiences for the kids. All of the staff I have interacted with are great at communication and the school has done a good job to maintain safety as well as a sense of normalcy during the COVID pandemic. I've toured many different childcare centres, and the physical space at CELC is second to none.  Preschool and childcare classrooms resemble a kindergarten learning space and are very spacious for the number of children there. They also have access to a full gym, and great outdoor playground and field.  Despite having a late birthday and being the youngest in her kindergarten and grade 1 classes, my eldest daughter was well-prepared for school as a result of her time at CELC.

Good class size, organized, clean, safe. But mostly its the connection my kids have with their teachers. Singing songs they learned in school, taking about their science experiments. It has more than exceeded my expectations. We absolutely love everything about this school.",

We even reached out after my second maternity leave ended to see if she had space for our 2 children but she didn’t at that time or we would have ended up going with her full time. We would always run into AJ and her family in the community and at different community events and she would always stop to talk, see how we were all doing and talk to the kids. She kept in touch via text message to check in and loves to hear about how the children are doing. I am now a stay at home mom for the time being but if I did end up going back to work I would not hesitate to connect with AJ and see if she had space at her dayhome.",

They ask about how I soothe him at home, his favorite activities, foods, and much more. Most importantly, they take this information and implement it while caring for my kid.

They had access to programs that equipped my son with essential behavioral and speech skills, setting him up for a smooth kindergarten start.\n\nIt's always a concern for parents to leave their child at an institution, but every morning, my son's enthusiastic wave from the window and his eagerness to play put me at ease. There were even days he wished to stay a tad longer, fully immersed in play!\n\nThe enrichment offerings, including a Spanish class, are an outstanding complement to their regular curriculum. It's delightful to hear my five-year-old son randomly use Spanish words he's learned, showcasing the practical application of his lessons.\n\nI wholeheartedly endorse UEA. Their intimate group setting combined with devoted educators makes it a nurturing and enriching environment for any child.\n\nThank you to all the amazing staff at UEA!",

Being new parents can be very stressful and let alone the feeling of trusting your little one with someone else but teachers of UEA made it so much easier for us. Transition time at daycare could not have been smoother than what we experienced, all this happened due to exceptional service and understanding of Ms.Ilinka and her team. Ilinka is kind, passionate and most importantly understands little ones and parents. I have 3 kids go to daycare, She is always there welcoming our little one at front door with smile each morning. She is one reason our kids love that daycare.\nI appreciate diversity within staff members so our kids are learning alot of different things/cultures. Outdoor and indoor activities are great and best part they are always introducing something new. Our kids are learning alot more. Lastly, I want to thank Roxana, She is very open to feedback and quick to action.

Their staff are so good with the kids & even take the time to get to know us parents. In addition, their extended hours provide flexibility for those of us without family support networks around us.

I later found out that when he did not like the food provided, instead of  offering him something different, he was allowed to starve. The teachers and care givers know nothing about providing care and they are so impatient and very quick to label kids negatively.\n\nOne of the teachers told my son that occupations like engineering is not for girls because girls are weak. What a horrible thing to teach a child! Another teacher told him that he was different because he is black. My son was told so many horrible things and it took months to get those ideas out of his head.\n\nI will never encourage anyone with a preschooler to take their child here.",

        "text": "By far the worst daycare in the city. If you’re looking for a daycare that lies to you when they forget to pick your kid up from school or have the bus driver pick your child up in their personal vehicle and speed with them in the vehicle then by all means send your kids here! Not only did they forget to pick a kid up from school they lied about why they didn’t pick him up instead of apologizing that they forgot. This daycare smells absolutely terrible, I feel bad for the other kids that have to sit there all day. As for management Lisa she is always in a terrible mood and has an attitude, even the kids know it. I’ve even witnessed Lisa screaming at parents on multiple occasions in front of the daycare. They also do not follow court orders so if you’re worried about confidentiality I’d pick another daycare. A daycare is supposed to be trustworthy and honest and this place is very far from that! Don’t waste your money sending your kids here! Most unprofessional run daycare ever, the owner and manager will call you and cop and attitude even though they can’t seem to run things right on their end. Before you call customers and have an attitude maybe ask why a child is being pulled from your terrible daycare. This daycare seems to forget that they wouldn’t be making money or be open without PAYING customers. There is literally no positive about this daycare Stay far far away from this disaster!\n\nUPDATE: The owner of the daycare did not ask during the phone call why the child in question was being pulled from her daycare just wanted to give her attitude instead of asking why. Only after the fact that I posted this review did she reach out to apologize! Terrible business practices. Steer far away from this daycare!! So unprofessional, they continue to lie saying the child was not forgotten at school even though he was as per your daycare manager. The smell from your daycare has nothing to do with how many kids go there. You did not follow the court order as your daycare manager was in contact with someone on the court order that she shouldn’t have been in contact with. If it was important to you to resolve issues they would have been resolved when the incident happened not swept under the rug and forgotten about. Instead you send a text at 6am that childcare is suspended leaving us unable to go to work and give your customers attitude when you call. By far the most unprofessional place to send children. Had you resolved this properly prior to your ignorant phone call this review would not be necessary.",

        "text": "My child was in Webber for years, starting in the very early grade. But we chose to leave and go to a better school. This school looks perfect on the surface, just like what you see with your eyes, but inside, it's not.  If you have watched their winter concert, you can feel that they are trying to show everything perfectly, tightly and meticulously, but the children have no emotional involvement and they are not happy. I pick up my child every afternoon at the front door of main building, I see all children coming out from building, they are not in a healthy and happy mood most of the time.  This is probably the style of this school, requiring uniformity, but never let the children be themselves.  School teachers have changed a lot. They have always claimed that their teaching should be ahead of other schools, but their teachers do not have the ability to do so. They rank high in the exam because of the tutoring arranged by parents for their children after school.  a large part of the children go to extracurricular tutoring classes after school.  So believe me, good grades come from extracurricular tutoring classes, not from that school.  The school’s leadership looks kind and polite, but is actually very cold and rude. This school is more like a running company, all for money.  And I believe that there is racial discrimination here, but it is not obvious.  So you can see some people say that school is good because they have been treated differently. Once I worked as a volunteer to help the teacher complete the art work on the corridor wall.  I saw children who had made mistakes were asked to line up and squat down in the corner of the corridor.  They are treated like criminals.  I don't think that humiliating children in this way can make them be better children. Humiliation education is the best manifestation of a teacher's inability to educate.  So what else do I need to say, a school without love and care.",

The school was just what we were looking for with regards to academics. After moving from Europe, we loved that the school provided specialty teachers for many of the subjects like music, PE, Spanish and Mandarin, because we didn't have that option before. They have all enjoyed participating in extra-curricular activities that happen during lunch recess or after school. My girls are so happy with the school and they wouldn't change a thing. I have been pleased with all the teachers and they all have been easy to contact and keep in communication if there are any questions or concerns. I find the teachers always answer emails quickly and I have never had problems scheduling a meeting with them. The administration and staff are always friendly and helpful when I've had questions. I love that many of the staff and the administration know the many of the students names from the Kindercentre all the way up to Grade 12. My daughters are in elementary school now, but I'm happy they will be at Webber Academy through Grade 12. I find the older students, as well as the younger students, are polite and they have great pride and satisfaction in their work and school.

The kids love all the activities they do, the outdoor time, and the menu. Parking can be a bit tight at times (out the front), but once I started using the parking lot out the back, I was always able to get a spot. There have been a couple of very minor administrative issues, but the team were always willing to work with us on them. The biggest standout is the teachers - you could tell they genuinely cared for our children. Wee Wild Ones should do whatever they can to keep them around!",

        "text": "My experience with Wee Wild Ones (WWO) has been on the administrative side and with their unethical business practice of nonrefundable waitlist fees.\n\nThrough my tour of the Fairview centre in May 2022, I was led to believe that with their new Currie location opening in Sep 2022  there would be availability for my two children to attend the Fairview centre. I paid $300 to place my kids on the waitlist, which would be applied to the first month of daycare. Based on what WWO told me, I felt confident that there would be openings for my kids. However, when I contacted WWO in Oct 2022 to inquire about availability for a Dec 2022 start, I was told there were no spots open. When I asked for my $300 to be refunded since I need to find alternative childchare for Dec 2022, I was told they would not refund the $300 waitlist fee.\n\nThis is not standard practice in the childcare realm. Other daycares would only charge parents if they actually have availability. It's deplorable that WWO would charge $150/child waitlist fees for some vague promise of the possibility of placement.",

        "text": "I debated for some time as to whether to leave a review or not. But after some encouragement from other parents…. here it is.\nOur experience with Wee Wild Ones was disappointing and we gave our 30 days’ notice after being there 1 month.\nThe pros:  The centre was bright and esthetically pleasing.  The classroom my son was in had a lot of natural light.  The educators themselves were very nice, and put in great effort for the daily indoor activities and near the end of our time there my son did enjoy being in their care.   We also appreciated the cloth diaper program and the daily reports.\nThe cons: The infant and toddler classrooms were really crowded.  My son napped poorly and came home overstimulated and worn out, which isn’t the case in his new day care.  Drop off parking was tight and busy and there is a ton of traffic in the morning with the high school being right there.\nOur primary issue was with the administration. To summarize, they seemed disorganized, inexperienced with confusing inconsistent policies and communication. One example of this was the repeated confusion over which program they were placing my son in. I had to get this corrected on three separate occasions, including the week before we were to start. There were other issues and conflict as well, which I won’t go into for the review, but happy to share if parents want more details. The first few weeks with WWO ended up being confusing, very stressful and we felt disrespected.\nThe kicker for us was when we followed up with the owner with our experiences, feedback and suggestions (which she had invited us to do) it was met with defensive and passive aggressive communication.  We have never received such a dismissive response from someone in her type of position. It made us realize if this how the owner communicates and handles feedback, this behaviour likely impacts the rest of the organization.\nI recognize our experience may not be the norm.  All I can say is that our current day care has never made us feel the way the management and owner of WWO did.  Plus, our son is thriving at our current day care- so he doing much better as well.  My advice to other parents is approach with caution and a critical eye. Visit it more than once (go when it’s open!!), get things in writing, ask for clarification, and don’t take what they say as “fact”.  This is a business that appears to be expanding, is lacking some experience and is figuring its self out, so they have some “learning” to do. Ultimately trust your gut if it’s the right fit for your family.",

Due to unforseen circumstances we had to pull out our 2 year old son the first week as he did not have a good experience there. We noticed he was sad most of the time on the liveview camera; and our son kept saying hi to one of the lady but she was not responding at all so we felt like our son was being neglected. We know it's a daycare that takes care of a lot of kids but at least put some interest or compassion, and interact with them, especially if its their first week. Our kid was still in a transition period and we were hoping they could have been more understanding and supportive. They are toddlers and they need some attention as well. Our son also got sick on his 3rd day and it is something we didn't expect at all; we heard that kids get sick most of the time if they go to bigger facility, but this is something we never thought would have happened on his 1st week. And lastly, since our kid was only there for 3 days and half, we were hoping that they would have been more understanding with our situation and will only make us pay a portion of it, but no, we still have to pay for a full month. We felt like that they are only doing this just for business and for their own benefit. So our big advice, before signing up..make sure your kid will be able to transition right away, expect for the unexpected and know that you'll be spending a lot of money if it doesn't work out.",

Cameras allow me to peek throughout the day to sooth my momma blues. Staff are exceptional and show genuine affection for all the children in their care. My child's happiness and easy smiles each day a testament to this nurturing environment. Food is well balanced and any special food needs are easily met.",

This location kept giving the same fruits (not much variety ) mostly used to be melons which was hard for infants to chew.\nThe classroom floors seemed like they weren't  mopped for ages, my socks got really dirty after spending an hour during the Christmas party, my child was always sick and I would find out that the teacher took my infant (who was a thumb sucker) to climb the staircase which was used by people with their outdoor shoes! Although the staff members all tried their best to greet you during drops offs and pick ups, it didn't equate in their interaction with the children in the classrooms. The teachers in the infant room looked miserable and didn't seem to enjoy their job.",

She has done an exceptional job in creating an environment that is warm and welcoming not just for the children but for parents as well. She always takes time to address any concerns we may have and ensures that every child’s needs are met. Ms Heather, Ms Yumi and Ms Dorie are absolutely amazing! Their patience and kindness are evident in the way they interact with each child in their care. I have felt so comfortable leaving my daughter with such friendly and caring teachers.\n\nThe facility is clean. There are plenty of toys, books and educational resources available, as well as an outdoor play area that is simply amazing. One thing that really sets this daycare apart is the level of communication and involvement between the staff and parents. We receive daily updates and pictures of our child's activities, which is both reassuring and heartwarming. The camera makes it easy and convenient to check up on my daughter throughout my work day.\n\nI would highly recommend Willowbrae Royal Oak to other parents looking for a safe and engaging place for their child!",

We were in Cambridge ON before and my son went to Willowbrae there as well and we had a very pleasant experience overall. He was a shy kid and he got settled very well.\n\nIn Sundance, Director Hannah is very friendly and responds to everything you ask of her. Sometimes there is not a clear answer in emails when you first sign-up but I think that is because English is not her first language. She is a wonderful person and my son loves all his teachers too. Great part is having a peace of mind as you can see the live cameras on the website or app which makes my day! :)\n\n100% recommend checking this daycare out. Expensive if you do not get a subsidy, but in my opinion, who else do we earn for?",

If you have any questions or concerns you get an answer from Hannah very quickly which is great! I feel like my little one is well taken care of and I find the staff SO WONDERFUL! Miss Jeandy in the infant room is the sweetest, and I can tell my little girl is really opening up and coming out of her shell thanks to the amazing workers, who are also willing to try work with me when it comes to her napping. I had her on a very strict nap schedule prior to daycare so the adjustment has been a bit hard on her, however the willingness to try different things has been great ! Amazing daycare and would recommend !!",

It's a very strict Montessori.\n- initially I was told they would practice mandarin with the kids but after enrollment, they said 3yr olds are too small to learn a 2nd language and they would only speak mandarin/Cantonese to the kids who can already speak it.\n\nUnfortunately this school has the potential to be amazing, but it just isn't there yet.

I've noticed that he has become more adventurous and is growing in his abilities and resilience. I feel that sending him to this preschool was a good decision. The programs offered by this preschool are excellent, but what I admire the most is the dedication and attitude of the teachers and staff toward the children. They embrace the children with love and provide consistent guidance. They also prepare healthy meals with fresh ingredients for the children every day. Since my son started attending Wise Kids Academy, he looks forward to going to preschool every day. He even waits eagerly for the days he can go, even on weekends and holidays.

The shy and quite toddler boy who was watching other kids to play and feeling afraid of trying things on his own has grown to a confident, energetic and personable boy who says hi to other people first and goes out to try new adventures outdoor or anywhere. Now my 3 years daughter is following her brother’s path there too. She is loving it so much everyday. Montessori programs with different ages helping them from the youngest to the oldest in all different way and helping them learn things even with toddlers’ strong will of independence. She is very proud of herself being able to do many things on her own there and learning in same time! Forest time is my favourite thing of  Kids program. Kids get to play outside getting dirty, muddy, watery in nature (in Actual nature not in playground) learning all sorts of things with all 5 senses, watching and feeling all different weathers in 4 seasons. All parents must know how hard to put the proper gears for each season from putting sunscreen and bug spray to putting boots and snow suits gloves and hats and so on. AMAZING Wise Kids teachers do this everyday!!! If anyone who is looking for a truly caring child care provider for 3 years and older, I highly recommend to contact Ms. Sunny or DM me. I can share all my 3 years experiences with Wise Kids Academy. Your kids will have the BEST childhood memories to remember for whole life.\n\nForever thanks to Ms. Sunny, Ms. Jin, Ms. Tiger, Ms. Ellie, Ms. Erin, Ms. Anne, Ms. Sandy, Ms. Sonya and Ms. Gloria, our kids have grown so well with your care and love.",

This preschool's commitment to the Montessori philosophy, personalized approach, comprehensive curriculum, safe environment, and supportive community make it a truly exceptional institution. I am immensely grateful to Zebra Crossing Academy for providing my child with a solid foundation and instilling a lifelong love for learning.\n\nThank you, Zebra Crossing Academy !!!",

        "text": "I doubt staff will see this post and care much as there is a mix of positive and negative reviews, but the negative ones are not met with constructive criticism. This leads me to believe nothing will be done in my case which is fine. I hope this post can help others to make an educated decision.\n\nI can only judge based on my experience, but this company did a poor job of handling our situation. We have recently moved to Calgary from Ontario. Finding daycare for your child is difficult to say the least.\n\nWe were recommended to Zebra Crossing by someone who has used their services in the past. When we spoke with the mahogany center, they advised that registration was full and turnover was far and few between. They made it clear that we would need to be on a waitlist if we wanted any chance to have our two year old enrolled. The waitlist was also full and we were told, if something became available, they would let us know.\n\nWe were told we would have to pay a deposit and that would be applied to the first month registration fee. Unfortunately, when we moved to Calgary, we were forced to settle into a different community. We thought, okay we will get back our deposit and enroll our child in a different facility. We were providing good notice and as we were told the waitlist was full. The assumption was there were many others to take out place. The harm no loss.\n\nWhen we informed the staff at Zebra Crossing that we no longer required the waitlist, we would be moving on, they become defensive and said that we would need to talk to head office. This was my first clue something fishy was going on. Charlotte advised me someone from head office would call me back.\n\nThere was no call! There was a poorly put together email from Sameer Khakhi: manager of accounting finance & operations that read \"there was no deposit paid, only a signup/registration fee\". I was furious. I sent an email explaining, that I understand that we may have inconvenienced the business (which I don't understand if the capacity was full). I also, offered to give some of the $400 that was held hostage to them as good faith for their time. No one has even replied. $400 for a registration fee for a daycare your soon isn't attending? $400 to remain on the waitlist? And if you don't join, you lose the money? NO! This is cruel.\n\nBest of luck to anyone that goes here. Just wanted to make sure our family's voice was heard.\n\nRegards,\n\nChristopher Campbell",

When I contacted them in Oct/Nov 2022 asking for a spot in Feb/Mar 2023, they seemed positive and reassured me that there were openings - asked me to pay the priority waitlist $150 which I did. Got an email in December saying that we will be informed of placement in 2 weeks - that was it!\nI was depending on them for childcare March onwards and I kept emailing and they kept saying they are full. They contacted me 2 weeks back saying they have a spot 3 days per week from JUNE!!!\nVery unreliable - the initial strategy of 'yes we have a spot' was to entice people to pay for the priority waitlist and then they disappear on you.",

        "text": "This looks to me more like a children’s mill than a daycare. I had a bad experience and took my daughter to another daycare even though I had left 6 more paid weeks.\nThey don’t hire enough teachers for all registered children, this practice is called overbooking, so every day, any reason is good to send the child back home, it’s very stressful to never know if your child will be accepted or not while you have to drop her and go to work. In the middle of the day, every reason is good to call you to take back your child and keep harassing you to come pick her up in the same hour, this way they can hire some teachers only part time and save more bucks (anticipating the fact that they will send back home some children in the afternoon).\nWhen you don't take your child to daycare, they call (after 10am, just to be sure you will not try to drop her after their call) and try by all means to make you say that she is sick so they have an excuse to not accept her for the next days.\nAlso even if the school is big, children are always in a small room, worse, each time I went there in the middle of the day, I always found them confined in a small corner of the room, and this gives the children barely 2 sq ft of space each.  In winter they never see daylight. This “daycare” will never do more than what is strictly mandatory by the law and will always find a way to apply every penalty or constraint they made you sign in the contract. They never care about children’s fulfillment. Last time I was there, because it was few minutes after 10am, they took a toy from my daughter’s hand, put her out of class like garbage, she was shocked because she didn’t understood why, this was the last time they saw us.",

        "text": "Highly recommend this daycare.\n\nThe staff are all super friendly and amazing with the kids, attentive, and patient. Everyday when we walk in to drop off or pick up our daughter, all of the staff take the time to say hello/goodbye and engage with her (and us) which she loves. It makes us feel very welcome and comfortable.\n\nThe facility is nice, organized, and very clean. Lots of variety of activities and toys for each age group. They take care of infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and before and after school care for older kids. They provide healthy meals and snacks.\n\nMy favourite part is getting to see all the pictures from that day posted on the parents group page. They always look like they are having such a fun time.\n\nI would love to shout out a few people, but that wouldn’t be fair because they are ALL amazing. I never have to worry about my daughter when I’m at work. I know she is in great hands!",

My Daughter has been attending Little Owl for the last four and a half years, and she is always excited to go back the next day. In the time she has been there, I can't recall a single issue that we've had with the centre.\nOne of the highlights is the daily report and pictures that are sent out on their activities, as it shows you what they did during the day. My daughter loves to look at it after school and explain to me everything they did - we also hear how great the lunch and snacks are all the time! My daughter has also made a lot of good friends there, and not just with the children, but a lot of the staff as well. Since she has been there so long, she has been through all the rooms in the centre and all the teachers she has had were fantastic. The staff at Little Owl have done an exceptional job at providing an environment that helps her grow as a little girl, and also giving her an environment to learn and be creative in. Send your kid here, you'll be glad you did.",

These ladies/gents have been amazing in providing my children with care, building positive relationships with my children and the family. The staff definitely make the atmosphere and program developmentally appropriate and allow children to have a voice. I absolutely love this childcare centre and have nothing negative to say about it.",
