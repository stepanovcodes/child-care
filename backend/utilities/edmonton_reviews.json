HOWEVER UPON ARRIVAL I WAS STOPPED AT THE DOOR WITH MY CHILD IN HIS STROLLER AND TOLD THEYD GIVEN MY SPOT AWAY 15 MINUTES BEFORE I SHOWED UP.\nUpon asking them to clarify that they had given my spot away. And they said yes in the last 1 hour they had indeed done just that! Even when I reserved it A WEEK PRIOR when I questioned the lady as to why the blonde lady smirked at me and nodded not saying a word.\nMy son is visibly special needs and I am aware that they lied to avoid taking him on to care for him even though HE HAS AN AIDE THAT THEY HAD CONTACT INFO FOR.\nTerrible daycare terrible service! Also I noticed when I walked in that they had a jungle gym Tree about 9 or 10 feet tall where kids were climbing unsupported and unsupervised. I also noticed that THERE WERE NO STAFF IN THE PRESCHOOL AND TODDLER ROOM but THERE SURE WERE ALOT ABOUT 5 OF THEM IN THE STAFF ROOM AWAY FROM ALL THE KIDS .\n\nUn hindsight super glad I won't have to deal with such a place",

They love their teachers and all the staff. Everyone is so loving and they care for my kids as if they are their own. They provide a daily report that details everything a parent would want to know about their day so we can ask questions and discuss the day. Each classroom is equipped with a camera with secure access for parents / grandparents to view our kids when we miss them. This gives us such peace of mind to just take a peek at their day. They go outside everyday as long as it isn't unsafe to do so with weather. There is a great private playground out back for kids to play in. They do so many fun activities and field trips. The facility is very well organized and clean. I would highly recommend this daycare center to any parent and couldn't be happier with the care my kids get. Thank you Barbara and team :)",

The three educators in the room are all incredible and so kind. I was nervous my daughters' first week and Linda reassured me that she would treat my daughter like her own, and she really has. 🥺\nI don't know the educators in the other rooms as well, but they always make a point to say hi to us when we arrive in the morning and bye when we're leaving, and it's honestly so appreciated.\nThe ladies in the room always keep us very well informed. If she gets hurt (even a minor scrape) they let us know and they fill out an incident report.\nThey plan really fun and engaging activities for the toddlers in the room. Lots of painting, colouring, sensory activities, music, parachute, bubbles, they even saw a turtle one day!\nOne of my favourite parts of the daycare is that they use an app that sends me pictures and updates of what she's doing throughout the day.\nIf I had to think of one critique it would just be that not all of the food they serve is made in house. I know that some daycares have their own chef, but A Place to Grow is also quite affordable compared to others. They allow parents to send their own food to supplement their menu. With the money we save here we can buy her more fruit to send for snacks! Lol\nOverall I would, (and have been) recommending this daycare to my friends!",

It was alarming to see ratios were repeatedly not maintained. I counted up to 17 mixed age kids all together with one worker several times. It was common to pick up our child in a soiled diaper. They have an outdoor area, but do not use it. The snow and ice is seldom cleared for safe access. Fish crackers are the staple food. Several times I came in quietly to see children huddled around a workers phone (I don’t blame the workers, they had far too many kids to handle by themselves). Our child afterwards told us they were locked in a room by themselves at times.  I cannot recommend this daycare to anyone I know or don’t know. Very disappointing.",

Their genuine love, warmth, patience, and dedication to early childhood education have helped our daughter blossom into a confident and curious young girl. We deeply appreciate and believe in their Reggio-inspired child care approach, which emphasizes hands-on discovery learning. We are grateful for the strong foundation they've given our child in learning, socialization, and emotional growth. If you're looking for a daycare that goes above and beyond, where staff truly cares about each child, Bambini is the place.

There is a culture here of continually trying to improve the care and education that they provide to the children. The educators actively participate in professional development opportunities. My daughter has been here for 4 years and has grown so much in that time, under the care of these amazing educators. From the infant and toddler rooms, all the way to the junior preschool and preschool rooms, we have been fortunate to have excellent educators caring for my daughter every step of the way. The extra programming, including Spanish, Music Together, and Yoga, is also top-notch (although sadly the pandemic has temporarily halted these extra programs). Would highly recommend Allen Gray.",

I paid the $100 registration fee and enrolled my daughter only to find out the numbers they gave me were incorrect even though I clearly asked them for the break down. I spoke to someone through email and over the phone and both individuals gave me different numbers. For a 50+ year old daycare, you'd expect them to know what subsidy and affordability amount is included and give the proper breakdown. My daughter went in for 2 half days and they tried to sneakily charge my husband for the full time fee. If he didn't inquire about the steep pricing, they probably would've gotten away with it. Definitely BE CAREFUL if you're considering this place. All they really care about is your money.",

It's an amazing daycare/OSC that is not only subsidized (therefore, have to adhere to regulations and occasional surprised inspections from the government) but believes in the Montessori learning objectives with very competitive child care cost. If you want to provide your child with a great foundation prior to Kindergarten, this is the place. My daughter (who's currently 4) know how to spell, identify, and write her name. She can also do basic mathematics, pronounce proper English words, and problem solve (think outside the box concept). Besides all those great things, Mrs. Barbar treats the kids like her own, she will discipline (not physically or yelling or anything like that) like how any mother would want to teach when a child does something that is wrong. For example, I've witness her telling another OSC child that she's asked that child not to do that numerous times and why she would think that's a good idea. They were in another room, so I know it wasn't an act. So, if you want a Montessori program that incorporates realistic value learning environment for your child and their growing minds, this is a wonderful option.",

Multiple times my child has come home with diaper rashes so nasty she would have open sores and be in so much pain, she could hardly walk. When I brought this up to Amy, she would gaslight me on the issues and tell me my daughter made everything complex for the staff. Even though we had workers there assuring us and updating us on the leaps in progress our daughter has made. Please reconsider sending your children to this daycare, if you can even call it that. This has been one of my worst failures as a parent allowing this person to care for my child, and I hope no other family has to deal with such incompetence.\nFor a daycare that prides itself on inclusivity, they are far from that, especially when dealing with children with special needs.",

They talk about the fun little activities that they do. I also like how before they leave the teachers make them clean up after themselves, it's a habit they carry forward at home. I also really like how they show them different cultures, the girls would tell me how much they think Sari's are so pretty.\n\nI want to give a special shout out to the owner and  Kristina, they are both wonderful people and you can tell they genuinely have a passion for what they do.\n\nI would recommend this daycare to anybody.",

This could have went ALOT differently instead of filing a complaint here,I could be saying goodbye to my 3 year old nephew who barley has had  a chance to live yet!!! I hope you are completely ashamed of this & I really hope you get a negligence charge or better yet shut down.

We dropped everything and drove there then took her to emergency.\n\nShe couldn't move her arm at all without excruciating pain.\n\nThey had paired younger kids with older ones, while understaffed, sort of letting the older kids watch the little ones. Great idea. Except they are just kids too and accidents will happen. The older kid was much taller and was running holding hands with my little one and yanked her arm in a way it shouldn't move... her tendon popped out of place around her elbow.\n\nI was really disappointed that the older girl was blamed for this. No one comforted her. She was crying in the corner. Feeling guilty.\n\nThe staff was only concerned with deflecting blame - onto a child. It fell on us, the parents of the badly injured kid - to comfort the older girl before we left for the hospital.\n\nThe character of a place is easier to see in an emergency. Bad culture here. They need to respect their own staff. Respect them. Train them. Pay them well. Don't play games with our kids. Trying to have more kids than staff, taking in more kids... Trying to maximize profits. This is daycare not minimum security prison. I'm just glad I found out. I'm glad my kid got out.",

We intend to have both of our daughters attend Appleton once I go back to work.\n\nThank you for all that you do!",

I’m not sure of the qualifications of the staff members.\n\nOrganization and communication could be improved.\n\nWe ultimately pulled our son due to the way the centre was unable to support potty training. At about 20 months old I asked the manager how the centre would support my son as I planned on potty training, her response was, “just let the staff know and they will follow your lead.” Our first attempt was unsuccessful, and a few months later when picking him up he said he needed to poop. I asked the same manager if I could take him to their potty and she explained they didn’t have an accessible toilet attached to the infant room (up to 2.5 years) he was in.\nWe ended up stopping attempts at that point, but he started withholding his bowel movements (resulting in multiple small poops in each day). Three days in a row I came to pick him up and staff were changing him and complaining how often he pooped and lecturing him about how he should use the potty.\nI corrected them and explained it wasn’t fair to tell him that if he wasn’t actually able to use the potty at the daycare.\nI couldn’t believe they were shaming him. I didn’t take him back after that day.\n\nHe’s been at a new centre for less than a month and part-time, and now is almost fully potty trained.\n\nWhen he was a baby I think the centre provided the support he needed, but I’m not sure the centre or staff in the baby room are equipped or set up well to support toddlers.",

As she got a bit older and started to age out of the room, her interactions with similar aged children became problematic and stressful for her.  She became so stressed and scared of the other children she would become sick.  She, a four year old at the time, was being beaten and bullied by a 3yr old male and nothing was being done about it.  The older child room (kindergarten and up) where my son was, was quite rowdy.  My son found it far too loud, and far too stressful.  In the summer, particularly last summer, almost the entire summer was spent in the hot school gymnasium rather than outside in the huge neighbourhood park.  The vast majority of summer programming was cancelled.  It was basically baby jail.  In the last one or two years this daycare has drastically dropped in the quality of care.",

They give you no time to eat your lunch and after won’t let you grab your outside stuff if you forgot it by your classroom. They have no activities for the older children. There are a lot of bullies in the daycare, one time some girl (grade 6 a few years ago) cried because we weren’t playing with her even though she didn’t ask to play with us when we went to the table and didn’t even talk to her at all. 4 year olds swear and so do the other kids. They make the boys go into the girls bathroom. You are forced into the gym after school to just sit on the bench while watching the littler kids slobber all over the newly polished floors and ride bikes that your not allowed touching. Kids will bite you and scratch you for no typical reason. Some of my stuff has went missing while having to go to this daycare. They bring ALL the kids to see Elmo, which for me I was really scared of him with his creepy laugh. When they served snacks they’d give you a tiny cup full and say you don’t get anymore. You have to pay like $260 for 2 kids when their only at the daycare after school, before, and at lunch. The question is how much you’ll have to pay when their in kindergarten or not even in school yet. Overall I would suggest NEVER bringing your kids to this daycare.",

Because of this, is why review is so poor. Her lack of communication has been very unprofessional and has left me scrambling for daycare 2 weeks from when I need it for son. I had him on the waitlist since July, have been asking for updates to confirm he has Spot and she said there wouldn't be any foreseeable issues for when we needed him in. I sent an email, having heard from a staff member that there was no space for my son,when I need childcare in 2 weeks and she said that there is no place for him now. Why was my daycare status being discussed among staff first when nothing had been communicated to me directly? As someone who runs the center I think she should more than understand how important childcare is so parents could work. She did not communicate any of this to me after we had been checking in, as I'm sure she would have had some indication much sooner than 2 weeks prior that there'd be no space. her behavior regarding this matter contradicts everything center stands for and expects from their employees according to their website.",

It is so  reassuring to know he is spending his days at a daycare he truly enjoys!  They have amazing teachers who create excellent and engaging activities for the children. The menu they offer is very healthy, with great variety. I would highly recommend Blackmud Creek Child Care. Your child is in the best hands with Corinne and her lovely team!",

The owner and the staff are engaging, kind, enthusiastic, and seem to really enjoy what they do. They bring the kids outside everyday and encourage free play, however they also incorporate structured educational activities indoors. The centre is clean and organized with all kinds of craft materials, books, and toys.  I feel good sending my kids to the centre every day knowing that they’re well taken care of and happy.",

From the start, Violet was very kind to wait for me after work to give me the tour. Teacher Kazi would give hugs to my baby when she was upset, and I knew she was in good hands. Their playground in the back is fantastic. They always sent me daily photos and even more if my daughter was crying when I left.\n\nWhen she turned 2.5yrs old, she moved to the other side with the older kids, where she made good friends, and teacher Evelyn was taking care of her and letting me know of all that happened. I appreciate the honesty and concern, so that we worked together to educate her. Sangam and Sukhman are also very helpful and supportive of the kids. My daughter says she has many favourite teachers. In particular, teachers Raj, Dilpreet, Meena, Sunita, Merci, really helped my daughter grow in confidence and gave me peace of mind when I’m worried about her. This is a fantastic location and I am really happy to have trusted this team for so long. I am sad now to change to another daycare because we moved too far, but we will cherish many happy moments from this place, from fieldtrips and barbecues and so much more. I would highly recommend this daycare to anyone.",

My husband and I were nervous sending our kids to daycare - it was the first time and they had never been apart or been in someone else’s care for any extended periods especially 5 days a week. I can honestly feel at ease knowing that I don’t have to worry about my kids, being a store manager my schedule can be a bit hectic but Eeshani is always accommodating and the staff are always happy to help with smiling faces at drop off and pick up ! They helped us with our subsidy application as it was our first time applying and when things got mixed up, it took 8 months to resolve and not once was I made to feel uncomfortable or like I was doing something wrong. They were so understanding and patient with the entire process even though there were very few and far between updates! I would highly recommend this daycare if you want your kids to be taken care of by kind and compassionate people who are amazing with children ! Our youngest is now walking and talking more as well as our oldest who has never had a day where she didn’t want to go to daycare !",

Another thing I really like is the creative ideas they have for the children to do - this summer they have done a \"mud day\", taken them for a picnic, taken them to an indoor playground, as well as to a local splash park. They are always coming up with fun things to do! Elsa and Marshall even visited one day!\n\nThe teachers are very caring and professional, and both of my kids have really bonded with their teachers and the friends in their classes :) Highly recommend Bright Horizons!",

My oldest son has been attending since he was 11 months old and still gets excited when I tell him he is going to see his Bright Horizons friends.

        "text": "*UPDATED after reply*: I said that I pulled him from his old daycare because he didn’t want to continue going after they went under new ownership, he didn’t like the new owners and staff after going there for a year and a half. I also confronted them over cutting his fingernails, which daycares aren’t allowed to do. But I didn’t bother to tell you they were mistreating him and that is why I pulled him out of there. And I brought him regularly in the mornings for the first month, after he refused to go I knew I would continue having a hard time considering your response and how you handle things. So I started bringing him less and less, until it because obvious that he would never be happy going here. Plus, you told me everyone else brings their kids at lunch time and you only have 1 kid in the morning anyways. Thanks for also texting me minutes after I post this review, asking if I’d give you guys another chance and bring him back. Don’t you have kids to be watching instead of jumping on your phones as soon as you get a review? And trying to mend it hoping I’ll delete this. There are also fake reviews on here written by the owners themselves off fake accounts.\n\nMy son went here for one month and then I could not get him to continue going. They seem like they do not know how to handle a child throwing tantrums or dealing with separation anxiety, which is normal in toddlers. Each morning my son would cry while dropping him off and the daycare workers would stand there staring at me and wincing in awkwardness not knowing what to do. This is my first time seeing this at any daycare, and I have been dealing with daycares for about 10 years now as I have an older child.\nThe final day I attempted to take him, he cried and they suggested I take him in one of the rooms and try to out him down for a nap. I rejected that offer, as it is not my responsibility to put my child down for a nap at daycare. Imagine if I had somewhere to be at a certain time and I could not spend time sitting there waiting for him to adjust because they simply don’t want to or don’t know how to deal with it. At that point, you might as well put me on payroll and I can forget about finding work else where and I can do your job while spending time there, and make money at the same time.\nNot sure why they chose to handle the situation in that way, but it gives off the impression that you don’t know how to take care of children especially in times of their distress. I don’t feel comfortable bringing my child here anymore.",

The quality of care is amazing, my son is always clean when I pick him up and never sits in a dirty diaper. This is his second home and it is great. Kobe loves Belinda and Rose. Another very positive thing is that the staff work on the children's fine and gross motor skills which is very important in a child's development.  :)",

At least this is what was told to me. I was asked by Anna to not bring my son from July.She has stuffed 18 kids in a room and putting pressure on teachers. Such was her ignoring my son that no photos or any updates was made on that app they have.\nHer cold attitude started when I didnot go for Brightpath's PUF program and chose another one instead.After losing the funding,she started creating hurdles so that I self willingly discontinue.She told no outside programs will be allowed whereas daycares cannot refuse out of reach PUF program for a child.When all these didnot work,she had to say that I have taken other kids and you have to discontinue.\nMany have positive reviews because their children can adjust here without any extra help,but not all kids are same. But if a special needs child comes,you get to see Anna's real face.\nEverytime I walked into that door,she would start sulking.Just had enough of her.",

Honestly they all are, there are really too many to name. Everyone has been so kind and attentive and accommodating whenever I have a question or request.\n\nThe educators are also absolutely wonderful. Meenakshi and Jashin (room G) and Sangita (formerly room G) were so caring and just hands down incredible with my son. It was so hard to transition him out of the room because he loves them so much, as do we!\n\nHowever, he's recently moved up to pre-school and his new teachers are also so warm and kind and caring and go above and beyond, especially to make him feel comfortable during the transition phase. They are very attentive and the detailed reports are extremely appreciated.\n\nHe has learned so much from being at Brightpath and there is no way I would have been able to have taught him anywhere near the amount that he knows because of attending. The curriculum is jaw dropping and so well rounded, I am constantly blown away when I see the reports of what he is learning.\n\nNever would have imagined my son would know his left and right's before he was 3! Nor would I have ever thought to even attempt to teach him that at such a young age.\n\nPrice wise of course you'll be paying more than a smaller centre or a dayhome, but in my opinion it's WELL worth it. We looked at the prices of surrounding centres that have opened up since he has been attending here and while we would be saving a couple hundred dollars a month elsewhere, the savings were not at all worth taking him out of this incredible centre.\n\nBravo Brightpath and bravo Heather for such a well run centre.",

However, the staff and management team acted very professionally and put our minds at ease by following all the health guidelines strictly and keeping the risk at the lowest possible level. They check kids temperature every morning, wash their hands frequently and santize the toys regularly. One thing that we love is how they divided the playground area into 3 sections to keep the cohorts separated. Also, the management are very transparent about every subject and we deeply appreciate it. Our son is happy there thanks to his kind and patient educators.",

I initially called them to inquire about a water purifier, and their response was nothing short of abhorrent.\n\nDuring my first call, the staff member informed me that they were in a meeting and abruptly asked me to call back later. Fair enough, I called back as requested. However, when I made the second call, the individual who answered was incredibly dismissive and impolite. Their lack of professionalism was evident as they impatiently told me to \"get to the point\" and repeatedly responded with a disdainful \"yeah yeah.\"\n\nThis level of disrespect and condescension is absolutely unacceptable. It's astonishing that a daycare center, which should prioritize the well-being and care of children, would treat potential clients in such a derogatory manner. I am deeply disturbed by the utter lack of customer service skills displayed by Cambridge Daycare's staff.\n\nBased on this encounter alone, I would strongly advise parents to steer clear of Cambridge Daycare. The callous and rude behavior exhibited by their staff suggests a complete disregard for providing a safe, nurturing environment for children. If they cannot even handle a simple phone conversation with basic courtesy, one can only imagine how they might treat children and their families in person.\n\nI implore anyone seeking quality child care services to seek alternatives to Cambridge Daycare. The unprofessionalism and disrespect demonstrated during my call indicate a deeply troubling lack of professionalism and care within their establishment. Please, for the sake of your child's well-being, look elsewhere for a daycare center that values both courtesy and the welfare of the children they serve.",

My son started there in 2014 and now my daughter is there and the staff is largely the same since we first arrived.\nThe friendliest atmosphere, the kids explore through arts and crafts and have the opportunity to read and be read to. It's an educational environment with a wide range of toys and puzzles that prepares kids for their schooling years. Staff take extra care to communicate how my child is behaving and cooperating with the others. Monthly emails reporting on activities and progress are sent and timely emails regarding changes in policies or important information keep parents up to date with expectations and requirements.\nI personally witnessed the work that went into the location change and the commitment made by everyone to make the transition. It is something to see. The layout of the new daycare is incomparable to any other. Plenty of open space with natural daylight streaming in, modernized kitchen, sinks and washrooms in every section. The pedway that centers the space is unique and beautifully constructed. The playground outside is inviting and spacious for kids to run and play.\nThere is a family feel to this place. I recommend it to anyone in search of a daycare for their child.",

Over a period of 9 months, my child was subjected to consistent bullying by another child, enduring daily hits to the head. Shockingly, the teachers failed to inform me about these incidents. It was only when my child reached an age where they could communicate about the situation that I became aware. Furthermore, it is important to note that unless you specifically inquire, the daycare staff will not disclose any injuries your child may have sustained.",

She is very understanding, calm and goes out of her way to help people who need help. She has done a remarkable job in keeping her staff knowledgeable by making sure they know how to incorporate Alberta Flight Framework when working with children at the centre. The children get many opportunities to explore the environment which encourages them to use their imagination and creativity. This is a great daycare for children to attend and staff members are highly educated and well trained in what they are doing with the children.",

No dropping of my 3 year old for a 2 hour program just to turn around and drive right back for pickup. CDO runs from 9am-3pm! They go outside every day, and they do tons of large motor activities and arts and crafts throughout the day. Both of my kids have gone together this year which I also really like. The teachers are great and the program is positive and inclusive.\nCDO is by far the most cost effective option too. With the new government subsidy the cost of sending kids 2 days a week is under $100/child a month!!\nThe volunteer portion and fundraising requirement are a little annoying, but I like that these keep the cost down for families. We paid out of the volunteer commitment this year as it worked better for our family.\nThe facility is older and I wish they did more music in the program, but those are minor complaints.  My kids are always excited to go in the morning and happy at the end of the day. You can’t beat that! Highly recommend!",

I was never recognized for my efforts; other parent board members who left the program were White and I am Chinese. I felt discriminated against. I helped the school save more than $120 in bank fees a year by getting them to change their bank account types. This school is great if you have a great support system and if you have retired parents who can help. This preschool is not very inclusive or welcoming towards busy working parents with little to no support system.

When I confronted the director about this, she denied it and said that it had never happened. I had four other people that I trusted confirming that it did happen. Eventually they changed the policy but still refused to acknowledge their mistake. I filed a complaint and as a result the director retaliated. She called my funding to complain that I ask too many questions and would not bring them an entire box of diapers at once. She also complained that I had filed a complaint. After this I gave my immediate notice. This daycare is not worth the drama. The prices are great but food wise you get what you pay for.

When my dayhome closed her doors to move to Toronto in the middle of the pandemic, I researched several options for care including both dayhomes and daycare options. I chose Country Club above all options. Samantha, the owner, and her team of care givers (teachers including Carrie, Maria, Shania and Gazelle to name a few) are like second moms to my kids. The kiddos love the variety of activities and the morning oatmeal! I love the pick-up/drop-off to school, lunches, outdoor play, and PD Day coverage that is included! Additionally, Samantha was always very diligent about making sure I was receiving the maximum amount of financial support through all government programs. These ladies are exceptional.

The worst daycare center with incompetent teachers who traumatize children. My child was constantly pushed and beaten by another child, and the teachers did not react or notify me about this situation. I learned about the bullying from my two-year-old child. But the educators kept silent all the time and said that everything was fine, although I asked them more than once if they noticed that my daughter was hurt by another child. My child stopped sleeping at night and started pulling out her hair when she he was nervous. After visiting a psychologist it turned out that my child was traumatized by the experience of attending this kindergarten. These are the most incompetent teachers who do not care about your children at all. They are obliged to provide your child with physical and emotional safety within the walls of the center, but I did not see it. If you want your children to be abused and you know nothing about it - come to this daycare, your child will be traumatized for the rest of their life. I am very disappointed and angry.

Trusting someone else to care for your child brings on a lot of stress and anxiety for a lot of parents. I remember attending Creekwood’s open house prior to their official start up. As we toured the facility, something inside me said “this feels like a good match for our family.” I’m glad I trusted my gut because I could not have been more right. Our daughter was well cared for, made many great friends, learned so much and was always greeted with a big smile. The facility is well kept and clean. The staff always have fun and engaging learning opportunities planned. Words can express how much we would recommend Creekwood.

Holy cow!  Curious Learners is hands down better than anything I've seen.  Learners' makes those other daycares look like prison cells with a few toys scattered around!\n\nOur little guy is safe and comfortable at Learners'.  They've been there from just a little guy that could barely crawl to a rambunctious, incredibly chatty toddler.  The staff are all amazing!

This has been our experience at Curious Learners.\n\nThe Director, Tammy Yulo, is a phenomenally dedicated, knowledgeable, nurturing and caring professional with a unique vision for the Centre.  She fearlessly leads her team of loving supportive educators/staff. We appreciate that there is constant feedback and communication. They even display and share insightful stories in the Centre of growth, experiences and interactions of the children and staff. These are happy such things to see.\n\nWe signed on after speaking with Tammy as she immediately was interested in sharing her experience and experiences to help our children. One of the main goals was making life easier at home with the daycare helping with transitions. We toured the facility and she instantly bonded with them and they with her, feeling very comfortable playing there for the first time. She made it a great experience.\n\nThe daycare gem is a newly-opened, spacious and well-maintained facility which is constantly improving. Located near a nice park/playground/spray park, it is in an ideal location. There is also a rooftop play area as well. The children enjoy healthy, nutritious home-cooked meals and snacks which are included. Staff are extremely diligent on cleaning and sanitizing all environments. Children are respected and assisted to progress with their best interest, independence and development in mind. They are helped to reach their potential.\n\nOur kids love going there every day. They have their own special place that is safe, healthy, educational, loving and nurturing which allows them to progress and be kids at their own pace with the staff and other children. They and we look upon everyone as a second family. Our kids are flourishing at Curious Learners and I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend them!",

We toured a few other facilities and walked away feeling impressed but something was missing for us.\n\nWhen we toured Kolobok, we were very happy with the educational program, AND could also feel their genuine warmth for the kids and their love of early childhood education. It made us immediately comfortable leaving our child here.\n\nWhen you walk in, you see happy kids, happy teachers and happy assistants. The staff have all been there for a long time, and I think both of those things speak to the positive environment here.\n\nWe all want our kids to be in a safe and positive place, and feel loved when we can’t be with them. This is that place for our child.\n\nThank you Kolobok!",

        "text": "I have nothing but but positive reviews for Discovery Nest. As a first time parent, my partner and I looked into multiple daycare and day home establishments. None gave as good a first impression as Discovery Nest. The facility is well laid out, well equipped, clean, and welcoming. The entire staff is friendly, responsive, and seem to have made a genuine connection with our child.\n\nDiscovery Nest uses the Brightwheel app to keep us informed of activities throughout the day -  we're informed of his nap lengths, what his meals are and how much is eaten, and all potty events. It keeps communication regarding needed supplies and upcoming activities very straightforward and easy to keep track of. Best of all, we get activity updates and photos throughout the day.\n\nMost importantly, though, our child is excited to go to daycare. He's happy when we pick him up, and lights up at the sight of the employees when we drop him off (he's under 2yrs so no direct feedback from him yet!). He is picking up skills, language, and positive behaviors that constantly surprise us. There is an obvious emphasis on education of the children.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Discovery Nest to any family looking for a daycare.\n\nUPDATE: Four years have passed, and our little one has now moved on into kindergarten. We're only a week into the transition, but that time has given me much more appreciation for everything Discovery Nest has done for him. He is thriving! There were no tears at the first drop-off. He was excited, eager, and ready to be there. On his first day, he mediated a dispute between two other children (\"they needed to take turns, so I got a timer\"). We've received very positive feedback from his educators - he's friendly, polite, attentive, and a joy to have in the class. Now, I'd love for my partner and I to take all the credit for that, but it's painfully obvious that the skills that have set him up best are the ones he learned at daycare.\nScarlett, Gloria, and the rest of the fantastic team there - THANK YOU!",

Starting daycare with a child that was born at the start of the covid pandemic was an uncomfortable feeling but Discovery Nest staff were so kind, thoughtful and professional. The daycare facility has a homely feel, the staff are happy and so caring and warm towards the children. My girl loves attending she is encouraged to learn new skills and enjoys the activities which are always varied, child centered and purposeful. The communication is also fantastic, I'm always kept upto date on my child's day and to be able to see the photos during my working breaks gives me a smile. Thank you Discovery Nest!!!!",

They communicate quickly with parents, and I always trust that my child is in very good hands. The programming is evidence-based, contemporary, varied, and puts the child’s learning and wellness first. Everyday is filled with developmentally appropriate activities (with environmentally friendly materials) that are inclusive and diverse. The language and problem-solving strategies that are used with the children are similarly intentional and thoughtful. The activities are then posted regularly on an app, thus helping parents feel connected to the Centre. The Directors/Educators ask for parental input into the activities and are so responsive to feedback. Guidelines and regulations are rigorously thought-out and make us feel safe even in a pandemic. Our kiddo loves having new adventures and dare I say sleeps/eats better at the Nest than at home! Thank you to the educators for your hard work, dedication, and genuine care for our children!",

Rideau Park has been a magical intervention straight from the Heavens above for him. Its like God especially hand picked a team of exceptional human beings to take care of him and shape his weaknesses into strengths and his strengths into power. I am sure you must wonder how I am writing this review in just two months of him being part of the system... its because in just two months my child comes home as a calm , organized child. Empowered with sign language that I could never have imagined him to be using and comprehending. The wisdom, patience and experience that these three ladies exhilarate is beyond words. (didn't share their names as i hadn't taken permission from the school)The endless energy they exhilarate is almost infectious. Having them in my son's life i feel he can conquer anything .They have opened unlimited possibilities with their knowledge. A small school driven only by passion, kindness and remarkable attention to detail. Just what any special needs would require. Indebted for life!!",

I think me not having the same beliefs had huge impact on my experience at that school. my teacher at the time really did not like me and i was not bad kid sure i wasn't perfect but i was i grade two. i sat outside of the class almost everyday and got in trouble a lot which i have never really experience other than this school. kids even bullied me and once someone stole something from my backpack and instead of trying to figure who it was she got mad at me and i had to stay in for recess i was. another time i got in huge trouble was when i accidently said oh my god and a lot of people from my class started to be mean but my teacher yelled at me and said she was going to call my parents over such a small thing i understand how that can be disrespectful but i was in grade 2. this was all a while ago but i really hope this school mainly my teacher to teach students with respect.",

We left there feeling confident that they cared about children and that they would do their best to help him be successful. Since he’s been there  we have noticed major improvements, he has started to feel more confident and we can tell he’s growing fond of the workers and building trust with them. It’s been a difficult and at times a stressful process, but they always make sure to let us know of all of the positive things he’s achieved that day.

A happy care giver will always have the enthusiasm to give their best so their passion towards helping kids reflects in their day to day work. My child gets to do a lot of activities here and most of the time returns happy 😃. If I start sharing the list of good things that has happened here probably will cross word limit. We are thankful to the educators for making potty training seamless. The total time taken was hardly a month since our child started going to the daycare. Ms. Sherry the current director is a very good manager and well aware of all the work that is going on under her supervision. Every staff probably feels the vibe and gives their best. We shall also be indebted to Ms. Vanessa, Ms. Angy, Ms. Brittany and Ms. Christina and everyone (I may not know the names of sorry) but who are involved from cleaning to preparing food and imparting fun filled play bases lessons and STEAM activities for all kids there. One other good thing to observe is that Edmonton’s weather is so unpredictable. However I feel relaxed to even know that the educators will have a perfect plan in mind to switch between outdoor and indoor activities for which touchwood very few children fall sick on a regular basis unlike other day cares we tried before. A BIG THANK YOU 🙏🏻 to all! Much love and respect ✊ please continue with your good work. Because it’s such a reliable support team depending on whom a parent can go to work with the inner confidence that their child won’t be neglected when they are not around to look after in person. Thanks 🙏🏻",

We feel compelled to share our experience and express our gratitude for the incredible care our little one has received. From day one, we were welcomed by a team of caring, understanding, and dedicated staff members. They created a warm, positive, and welcoming atmosphere that not only made our child feel secure and comfortable, but also fostered a sense of belonging. We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Sherry and the entire team. The memories formed here will undoubtedly remain with our child.",

Pretty much management doesn’t care about part time or drop in attendance . They would literally tell you that they will give u the response whenever they feel like it . U would not even be able to drop in until later in the day if you able to get in . They just want full time attendance they can care less if you bringing ur child for part time . They would just give you the worst treatment .Same way they would treat ur part time kid in the day care not like others . Worst day care ever !",

As parents with a very fast pace lifestyle we do worry where we leave our kids and here at Elwood I always felt great leaving her behind. I wish this place nothing but success and hope the city our govt can start funding Daycares like this properly so parents don't have to pay a fortune.

        "text": "I'd like to provide some feedback based on my experience in ENGL108 under the instruction of Safia Ahmad at MacEwan University. Initially, I found the course guidance somewhat ambiguous, as the assignments were issued without supporting rubrics. Despite my previous academic successes (a BBA Honours degree from NAIT with a GPA of 3.92 and a BSc degree with Distinction from UofA with a GPA of 3.7), I struggled to meet the grading criteria, which were not clearly articulated.\nDuring my entire academic journey, I have never previously encountered such low assignment grades without receiving appropriate explanation or constructive feedback. This led me to perceive a certain lack of clarity in Ms. Ahmad's communication with her students and a need for improvement in her organization skills.\nAdditionally, a series of quizzes we undertook were marred by various errors such as misspellings, incorrect answers, and issues with grammatical accuracy. I had to take the initiative to contact Ms. Ahmad on multiple occasions due to errors in the answer keys, which added an additional layer of frustration to my course experience.\nI regret to say that I found the response from MacEwan University to my concerns regarding academic competence, course content, and grading, less than satisfactory. As a result of these experiences, I felt compelled to withdraw from the ENGL108 course under Ms. Ahmad's \"teaching\". However, I subsequently completed the course with another instructor and was pleased to achieve an 'A' grade.\nIn light of my experience, I would urge MacEwan University to review their hiring processes, specifically when recruiting from countries beyond the G7, where verifying qualifications can be more challenging. This is not to question the skills or experience of educators from these regions, but merely to ensure that the university continues to maintain its high standards of Canadian education.",

An incident the Thursday before, i go to pick up my child from daycare, he and other children were playing in the halls. I go to grab his jacket from his locker, turn around and he is gone. He ran out the front door right in front of them and they insisted that he was still inside. While i wasted that 5-10minutes searching for him inside, he was outside on the street. I called daycare accreditation and they are going to investigate. I pulled my son out immediately. This is unacceptable. I have a few more complaints but the bottom line is \"this is the worst daycare my child has ever been in\". Watch your child and the staff very closely if you choose this daycare. They did not even have a clue why my child had a gash beside his eye. They just noticed that his face was bleeding!! Awful and absolutely rude",

To me, it is one of the most caring daycares with incredible and exceptional facilities in town. My daughter was here for 4 years. Even though she is in school now, she always relishes the memories of days she spent here. We are so contented with the services, environment and professionalism that I have enrolled my granddaughter too in this center. She is also very elated and joyful. I wish her to be here for years to come.\nThe center has all state-of-the-art facilities for indoor and outdoor activities including art & craft, multicultural, seasonal and recreational services for different age groups of kids. I am delighted to share that, among other amenities, halal food is also served and dietary preferences like allergies (if any) are also taken care of. Even in these critical times of pandemic, standard and quality of service has been maintained. Guidelines laid down by the Govt. of Alberta are followed with specialized care and regular thoughtfulness.\nThe director has qualities of head and heart. She is experienced, qualified and consummate in her proficient outlook and personality. Her behavior with staff, families and authorities is so inspiring and motivating that all team members of daycare vouch for it.\nI would highly recommend this place for those who are looking for comfortable and creative pastime for their children.",

When I went for a tour the Director ensured me, they followed all the health and safety protocols outlined by AHS. Starting a new Daycare and being exposed to so many new children and adults I was prepared for my son to catch a common cold or sickness. To my surprise and delight he has not been sick once. This confirms how clean and sanitized the center truly is. When I drop my son off in the morning he is always greeted by a warm and caring staff member. My son is always in good spirts and seems very happy and comfortable at the center. My son is a very picky eater and often refuses to eat. The staff and owner always make an effort to try and get him to eat. They have often given him ketchup or ranch so he can dip his food in (which for some reason he loves) or offer a different choice. I really enjoy the private Facebook Page that keeps me updated on what’s going on in the center and I absolutely love seeing the pictures of my son playing 😊. Great center!!!",

I was enthusiastically told there was space and to come in for an orientation.\n\nDuring orientation with the owner, I asked a few questions about childcare any concerned mother would ask. For example, I asked the infant teacher how she deals with children who cry during their first time in daycare. The owner said that it's good I ask these types of questions since many parents don't. Anyways, my husband and I liked the centre and left.\n\nWe then phoned that Friday to register. We were told to call again Monday morning, and I informed them that we would then bring our child for a couple hours as his first transition day. Monday morning (last week of Sep. 2017) I phoned at 6.30am to confirm we are coming and I get a call back at 7am from the owner that unfortunately there is no space as she has a director (whom she never told me about) that apparently booked and registered another infant without telling her. She said she'd call me back later in the day to see if she could re-arrange with the other parent as they also wanted part-time, so maybe we could do alternate days. She never phoned.\n\nMy husband and I found this entire situation odd, so he phoned the following day on Tuesday from his cell, inquiring if there was space available for a 14 month infant for the first week of October/right away. The owner answered enthusiastically that there was space and he could come and register his child right away as there were only 4 kids in the infant room. When I called half an hour later from my cell, asking if she has space, she answered that she is full...\n\nThe owner outright lied to my face. Why? Because I asked some questions? As a concerned parent and mother, I would urge every parent sending their child to THINK TWICE about sending your child to this daycare. To me it verifies the authenticity of multiple online reviews that state that children may be neglected and/or parents who show even a little concern are NOT WELCOME here.\n\nI am grateful that I did not enroll my child in this program and that I found out the nature and true colors of the owner and this centre.",

The kids spend lots of time outdoors with the newly renovated natural playground for the little ones and have access to the sports field, skating rink, spray park and ravine for the older kids. They have a wonderful summer program including field trips. As a not for profit the parents and families are very engaged in the programming with lots of communication and the opportunity to work with the dedicated and excellent centre management through participation on the board or even some of the committees. The kids are always treated with respect and taught all of the things you would want to - positive ways to resolve conflict, sharing, manners. Our kids are always happy to go, love their staff and rooms and as a parent I feel confident going to work knowing they are having a great time and are well cared for.",

My son would be starting daycare as I returned to work from maternity leave but it was also the year we met one of the most caring providers around who quickly became family. Choosing someone to fill your role while you are gone, is not for the faint of heart. From the moment we met with Gurinder we knew our son would be in the best of hands. The amount of pure love and dedication to every child in her care was palpable. Not once did we ever have to worry while being away from him. He transitioned with her and her family as they ended their home based daycare and took over ownership of Future Stars Child Development Centre. Everyone at the daycare centre is wonderful. Plenty of opportunities for play, learning, cultural immersion, home cooked meals and reasonable rates! Our son has now transitioned out of their care into a new place in preparation for school next year. It was one of the hardest decisions we have had to make. I know how hard it is to entrust your child's life and wellbeing into the hands of others. You will not have anything to worry about here! We love you “Aunty Guri”!",

The program is a Reggio Emilia inspired and the teachers are skilled at designing a curriculum that inspires curiosity and fosters a greater understanding of key concepts. Our son joined the program during the pandemic in Sept of 2020, and has attended the Wonder Room and the Discovery Room. They managed to keep the students safe with increased hygiene protocols. With student's safety at the forefront, this program has created a successful and safe learning environment.\n\nI would highly recommend this program to anyone looking for an early learning centre for their child. They successfully integrate outdoor time and indoor learning centres - and the staff are very knowledgable and skilled in early education. They create a comfortable environment - and from the first day, our son entered the school - which was unknown to him and everyone was masked - he felt instantly comfortable. This is due to the warm and inviting nature of the team of teachers assembled. This program has a long history of serving the community.\n\nThe teachers work closely with the parents to provide a collaborative learning environment that is supported at home.",

Our daughter loved going to daycare, the hardest part for us was when we moved for my job and she had to change daycares. They treated her like family, she was well cared for and loved. As a first time parent I was extremely skeptical, hesitant, and overly protective. The owners (who are a husband and wife team), and their wonderful staff, put all my concerns to rest and I was able to drop my daughter off each day knowing she was in the best hands. The facility is clean, the food she had daily was delicious and filling, she made lots of friends, they had easy ways to contact them if you need to change something or if our child was going to be late (and she was all the time), they worked with us on our needs and recommendations of our pediatrician, and! she learned so much from the staff, her development was crazy! If you are looking for a daycare in the Edmonton area. This, this is the place you want to send your children, do not look anywhere else, its not worth your time. Close the other windows you have open with daycare options, and just contact Gilgal and set up an appointment. Seriously best choice you will make today.\n\nAlso they are genuine about their faith. As a Christian myself I wanted a Christian daycare for my daughter. I was happy to know they are Christian and live out those values in how they treat others.",

My kids are never unhappy to be dropped off and are happy to see me when I pick them up but not in a rush to leave which is a good thing.  The staff answers all of my questions no matter how many I have and are true partners when it comes to milestones like eating solid food, toilet training, etc.  I never worry about the care my kids receive.  They are also always doing fun things like Canada Day parties, fashion shows, lemonade stands, etc. There is so much genuine care and effort that goes into everything that they do.  I am so happy to have found this daycare for my kids and highly recommend it to anyone.",

        "text": "Glenora Child Care Society has exceeded all my expectations.\n\nThe staff at GCCS are kind, loving, energetic, respectful teachers that bring excitement to my daughter's life, day after day. The classrooms are open, inviting and playful, and the outdoor space is constantly evolving and a highlight of the center. My daughter regularly eats lunches that I would pay top dollar at a restaurant for, all thanks to the in house chef, Noriko. And most importantly, the connection between the kids, teachers and fellow parents makes this center special.\n\nThe amount of outdoor play that the center fosters is unprecedented - at least 2 hours a day outdoors (weather permitting - though snow and coldness are usually only factors during season transitions, where some kids may not have all their gear yet -). Open ended and \"rough play\" are encouraged, under supervision, and children are often playing with friends of various age groups. Given the amount of cold weather in Edmonton, it would be remiss if a center did not have adequate strategies to deal with snow and negative degree temperatures. Last year, the center only had \"indoor days\" during the Polar Vortex and a select few other days. Most other days, the kids will be outdoors. It also encourages the family to explore the outdoors, since we know that the children are used to being outside. GCCS even loans out snowshoes during the wintertime to eager families.\n\nAfter speaking with the staff, I was also pleased to learn that they are happy to work at the center - well paid, benefits, overtime, fully staffed and with  excellent opportunities to improve their skill sets. Other parents I have spoken to have had several of their children go through GCCS and have been so happy with their experiences. After discussing with many friends, I have also discovered, happily, that GCCS rates are very reasonable given the caliber of the center.\n\nWhen my daughter was starting at the school, she was 18 months old - hesitant to take even the smallest set of steps - and constantly asking for the assistance of others to help her do tasks. At GCCS, she grew into a very brave, independent, thoughtful learner. She is 3.5 years old now, and can set the table, put away dishes, serves herself (usually healthy) snacks, and can dress herself with her winter coat and accessories. Best of all, she loves her friends and her teachers. Each day she has amusing stories to tell and with the App, I can usually prompt her to tell me more about her day.\n\nWhat an incredible environment for our daughter to learn how to be a part of a community of caring humans.",

Communication with the centre director and educators is always open and quick.

        "text": "PLEASE BEWARE . I up until recently had two of my children attended this \"daycare\". Back story I had I my boys enrolled in the \"daycare\" for about 3.5 years. The first, 2ish years were great my kids were happy, staff around was consistent. Communication with the workers was great.\n\nThere seem to be a change in management roughly a year ago. That's were things took a turn for the worst. My youngest (4) son in that time became so unhappy and frustrated that he was \"lashing out\" at the center. So i tried to work together with the current manager to come up with a plan she her self said the daycare was not up to standard. To rectify the situation a plan was made and improvements seem to be happening, well was I ever wrong.\n\nThe constant staff change with no follow through on the plan (there part) my son began to slip again. This time around the manager would become extremely rude on the phone and in person. She would call ordering us to pick up are son. Which we complied with. She would send a video of my son crying very distraught and upset like a video that would break your heart if it was your child. The puzzling factor was my son would not act like this at home.\n\n3 days before I started back at school we recieved a termination letter from current manager. In hindsight it was the best/only good thing she did for my child.\n\nDigging a little deeper we found out through staff and other kids. That my son was being bullied. He was being constantly singled out by some of the workers calling him a bad boy, and the staff would Tell the other children. Do not play with him as he is a bad kid. This is basic BULLYING\n\nI was heartbroken I couldn't believe as a parent I failed my own child. I actually believed the manager (current). It turns out she did not have the best interest in my child. It made me sick to my stomach when I found all this out.\n\nThe number of infractions is actually incomprehensible. Some of the most basic things were violated. Having cleaning supplies under the toddler bathroom sink. Not enough staff supervision in rooms. You can actually look these up as they are available to the public.\n\nThankfully I have both my sons in a new daycare that actually cares for there well being. The amount of change in my youngest son since the new daycare is so much. I couldn't be happier. He is getting back to his old self finally.\n\nIt's funny how when we drive by the old daycare he gets scared, nervous and always ask me if he has to go to the old \"daycare\". I just turn to him and tell him he will never go back to that daycare. You can see how relieved he is when I tell him that.\n\nNow, I know that she will respond and try to slander my review that is just how they roll at this \"daycare\". But thats a bully mentality.\n\nSincerely Kyle",

They also updated me after each day regarding how his day went, what he had for lunch, etc. The rooms are spacious, bright and minimalist with a Montessori feel which I love as I believe it fosters imagination. Their arts and activities also foster imagination and recycled materials. I appreciate that they take the kids outside for fresh air whenever the weather allows. It's also nice to be greeted by the co-directors at the front daily. We left the daycare because we had to move provinces but we have yet to find a daycare that we loved as much, Harvest Pointe Daycare set the bar high!",

I didn’t understand why when I was trying to get my daughter familiar with the daycare. The director told me I wasn’t allowed to stay in the room with my daughter for longer the 10 minutes. I mentioned I have visited other daycares as well to get an idea of the program and not one of them has sent me away based off these policies. She then told me I should go with one of those other daycares then. I thought that was pretty rude and the whole experience was a waste of time and yes, potentially a break of confidentiality or whatever she stated because yah, I am being turned away and unwelcome there.\n\nBased off the poor communication and disrespect that was given there I won’t be enrolling my daughter.",

The senior staff there and has been incredibly loving, warm, inviting and accommodating towards my daughter and her needs. There is a minimum ratio of 1:4, but there always 2 staff members and a maximum of 8 children in the room. The food smells great when I go and they have assured me it is all made on site and are all home style meals - my daughter is a picky eater at home and the feedback I get is that she eats really well there. I've gone to pick up my daughter at different times during the day and whether she's outdoors or indoors she seems to be happy and safe. She adjusted very quickly to the new environment and I give full credit to the staff there!\nThe admins (2 women) seemed really nice to me, too. They could be a little more professional with some of their paperwork (when I dropped off my deposit I did not get a receipt or anything and remember my name & number was written on a little piece of paper which made me a little nervous but they did hold our spot and everything turned out fine) but no place is perfect and I did not come across anything that was poorly done (from what I've seen anyway!) I do wish they had a website where they posted pictures and updates (private access to parents), but I get most of my feedback from the staff in my daughter's room anyway and they give me a daily report of how she did for the day when I pick her up (verbal, nothing written). I also wish they gave the parents a weekly menu of the meals they eat, I haven't asked for one so maybe I should!\nThe place itself is an older building but clean and the rooms have lots of natural light and kept tidy (again, I've dropped in at different times during the day). My daughter's been happy there and safe.",

        "text": "Our daughter attended this daycare for 4 years, and I can’t say enough good things about our experience with them. They employ such warm and welcoming staff, that I never hesitated leaving her in their care. Truly, they became her second  family, and I felt so relaxed knowing she was people that would care for her with such love and kindness. Sheri and Hans deserve a special mention, as my daughter spent over a year in the preschool room with them. They engage the kids, encourage them, and were great teachers of empathy and kindness.  We were so sad to say good bye, and even still my daughter talks fondly of them.\n\nHelping Hands has a great outdoor play space. I welcomed how messy my daughter would come home, knowing she was playing in and exploring the outdoor space. The indoor space was always clean and well maintained.\n\nWe felt so lucky we found Helping Hands and can’t recommend it enough!",

        "text": "We’ve had our son at Helping Hands for 2 years, and have loved it!  The teachers are all really wonderful and caring with the kids. The outdoor space is like none I have ever seen at a daycare- it is a full park with trees, a garden, play-sets, and lots of toys for the kids to enjoy. My little one never wants to leave when I pick him up from the park!  They let them play and get a little dirty outside… like kids should :).  Through the summer they also made weekly trips to a nearby spray park.\nWe made the mistake of attempting switching daycares to one slightly closer to home for the convenience, but we were back at Helping Hands after a week! We quickly realized just how amazing the care he was receiving at Helping Hands was, and we were wrong to assume it’d be the same at another daycare.\nThe owners obviously do a great job with hiring as the teachers are all fantastic, and there has been very little turnover in their staff.\nI would recommend Helping Hands to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, laid back, and home-like experience for their children, with the security and reliability of an accredited daycare.\nProvided meals are coming back soon too…woohoo!",

The care my daughter receives here is amazing. I never worry about her there and I see first hand how loved she is by the staff. She has flourished here. Her language blossomed, she made friends and I always felt like she was well taken care of. The centre is safe, has an excellent outdoor area and is close to parks and spray parks that the staff take the children to. I was scared to put my child in daycare at the height of the pandemic, but Helping Hands was exceptional in every way and it made me feel good about my choice to send her there. Thank you Amanda, Hardeep and staff! You are lovely and we will miss you very much.",

She has a knack to make kids understand in the first go in the most amazing way. My little guy just loves her. All the teachers here are very helpful and have great activities for the kids. My son moved from the Babies group to the toddler group, to pre-kindergarten group and will soon move to the Kindergarten group and I am sure he is growing up great.

If she is now a bright, sociable, well-mannered little girl is - to a great extent - this team's merit. Everyone was extremely warm, professional and caring. As a working parent - there was no greater relief than knowing that Sophia was impeccable taken care of while I was away from her. THANK YOU Honey Bunny Daycare!",

We noticed some toddlers (no older than 2/3) walking across the parking lot, unaccompanied. There were two of them and they were walking straight towards 62 street, obviously intent on running into the road. We stopped them when they got to the sidewalk and asked where their mommies were. They couldn’t talk very well yet, but we heard some kids playing in the playground behind the daycare. So we picked them up and carried them back. The caretakers there hadn’t even noticed these two little boys were missing. We returned them safely back.\n\nI posted about this situation on Facebook because I felt this daycare would not report this incident to parents. I was right. The mother of one of these boys contacted me and informed me that they didn’t tell her what had happened. The day care then informed parents AFTER my Facebook post. They also stated they felt they didn’t need to report this to licensing.\n\nIf they are willing to hide this big of an incident, what else are they willing to hide?",

My kids’ agency is respected, they are confident, and never want to leave (which is my only complaint). There’s a big gym to play in on miserable days and a huge play park and field on the better ones, not to mention a food program.\n\nWe looked at way more than a few daycare options and this one blew us away. Walking in, the atmosphere is so welcoming, there is art, so many cultures are represented in each room and the hallways and all the materials and toys are as natural as possible.\n\nWhat an outstanding program (and educators!!!) that goes above and beyond, building confidence and character in our next generation. Our family is so fortunate to have gotten a call, I suggest adding your name to the wait list as soon as possible.",

They don't have a formal canadian standard education or any experience and yet get a job to work here.\n\nThe supervisor Divya has a history of slapping kids yet she gets promoted to be a supervisor. She lacks the necessary skills to be a good child care provider and should have been fired for her repeated mistakes.\nShe lacks hygiene.\n\nThe quality and quantity of food kids get here is below standard.  Some staff prepare meals but are not certified to do so. Parental intervention is required in this matter. Parents have the right to know and see what their child got to eat at the daycare everyday.\n\nSome members of the staff are unable to supervise kids in the park. They are on their phones or yapping with other staff members or eating snacks,  leaving the kids to play unsupervised in the park.\n\nStaff lack knowledge in preparing weekly lesson plans. Staff are not given enough time to prepare lesson plans.\nStaff to children ratio are nor always met.\n\nKids are not supervised well in their classroom as some staff are constantly on their phones or leaving their rooms for personal reasons.\n\nSome staff help themselves to food from the kitchen whenever they want. They sit and eat in the classrooms when they should be supervising kids",

When the registration is completed, a welcome package will then be forwarded. We were excited that we had an opportunity at our first pick facility. So, we stopped searching and declined other opportunities that contacted us as we didn't want to hold up spots for other parents waitlisted at those other places. I guess that's where our mistake was made, we put all our eggs in one basket. We never received a registration package from Kepler, even after following up and are now searching, again, for quality child care. Good times. It's been a few weeks since any communication or reply.  What's the point of having your customer service rep and client experience lead cc'd on the email communications only to be ghosted? At least one of you have the professionalism to email back whatever the issue was. Isn't that the point of your roles, to follow up on the experience or service that is being rendered? I've gone back and forth about posting this review. However, I'm also in a high level admin role and know how these processes work and this is just terrible. Just poor consideration of a family's time and effort looking for child care when it's already not easy to do.",

        "text": "Parents Beware- Fraudulent Activity\n---\n\nI enrolled my three children at Kepler Academy at Sunlife Place from January 2022 to August 2022. Unfortunately, our experience was marred by several significant issues.\n\nTo begin with, we were quoted a monthly fee of $1,700 after grants. However, during the first three months, we were charged over $3,500 per month, totaling a staggering $10,500 for that period. The lack of communication and clarity regarding this discrepancy was deeply concerning. Attempts to seek clarification from the director only led to conflicting and unclear explanations.\n\nThe problem persisted for nearly six months before the charges were finally resolved. Even obtaining statements of costs for tax purposes became a protracted four-month ordeal, extending into April 2023.\n\nThe breaking point that prompted me to write this review occurred in August 2023, more than a year after my children attended the school, when I received an unexpected charge of $200 from Kepler Academy. My wife made multiple attempts to contact the director through email, phone calls, and text messages, all of which were marked as read, but received no response for over 30 days.\n\nI visited the academy in person to resolve the issue. To my disbelief, the director attempted to deflect responsibility and claimed that our billing team had contacted my wife. However, she couldn't provide a clear reason why, after 12 months of service, our account was being charged. There had been no prior email notifications, physical mail, phone calls, or any indication of an outstanding bill.\n\nWhen I requested a point of contact in the billing department, I was met with refusal, as the director stated she couldn't provide that information and insisted that I contact her directly.\n\nRegrettably, I am now compelled to involve my bank and initiate a fraud investigation against a company that I had initially considered reputable.\n\nThis experience has been characterized by a lack of transparency, poor communication, and unexplained charges, leaving me deeply dissatisfied with Kepler Academy.\n\n——\nUpdate Sep 14 2023\n\nWe have yet to receive any communication in the form of a statement or invoice that clarifies the rationale behind a $200 charge, which was incurred over a year after our departure from your service.\n\nIt is disconcerting that it took a public post to prompt any response to our inquiries. Even following that, neither the Centre Director nor the Finance Department has taken the initiative to reach out and address this matter.\n\nIt is essential to highlight that withdrawing funds without notice or authorization, especially one year after the termination of a service agreement, is a practice that lacks transparency and professionalism. Had there been an outstanding balance in our account due to an audit, we should have been promptly informed and provided with a statement.\n\nWe are at a loss as to why our account would carry a balance, as we consistently adhered to timely fee payments and provided over two months' notice upon our departure from the facility. It is not our responsibility if the Finance and Billing department encounters difficulties in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of parent account fees and subsidies.\n\nMoreover, in addition to these unauthorized withdrawals, the Centre Director's refusal to acknowledge our numerous calls, emails, text messages, and in-person inquiries has further exacerbated this situation.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we formally request the immediate return of the funds in question.",

Parking turned out to be no big deal since there are multiple 15 min loading zone street stalls in front of the building and people are pretty quick with drop offs. We have never had a problem with parking out front.\n\nI must admit the first month was rough with our daughter (and us) getting used to daycare, but now she absolutely loves it and is always happy to see her educators and friends everyday.

The first few days she cried a little, but Eleni and Sukhleen are amazing teachers, they are very loving, have lots of patience and made this transition much easier for us. The centre director, Sunita, is very attentive and dedicated to the centre. She also makes sure to know every child and family that attend Kepler. Actually, within a week, almost everyone knew who my daughter and I were. I felt I was welcomed into a family. Sheila, is always smiling and welcoming us when we get to the centre. I feel safe when I talk her as she is always reassuring me that my children are doing well (you know how this transition can be harder on parents than on the children!). The food menu is diverse and rich in fruits and vegetables, so I don’t have to worry whether my daughter is eating healthy while there. Actually, we get daily updates on what and how much our children eat (plus a picture of an activity!). The activities are well thought out and appropriate for children age and development. My daughter developed a lot since she started at Kepler, in all aspects, cognitively, physically, socially, and emotionally. She didn't speak English at all, now she cannot wait to say \"hello\" to people on the street and talk to them. My son (18-month old) is also attending Kepler now, he started in July. I cannot say enough how much I appreciate his teacher, Sujata. After a few weeks he would go to her without crying. She gave him lots of attention and love, she is always smiling, kind, and has the best humor. She is on top of everything and very approachable, making my life way easier when I drop and pick up my son. I am so lucky to have both my children attending a great centre! They have many more great people there. Teacher Happy and teacher Veronica are sometimes in charge of my children and they are so lovely and caring too. I have a feeling they like what they do and are happy in their professions. What else could I mother ask for?",

Fun fact, when I asked the last daycare director (had 3 come through in 15 months) if she was curious to know why I was pulling my kid out of there, she simply told me no... and that just validated even more my decision to move away from that Kepler Academy location.",

        "text": "Amazing facility! After a not-so-great experience with one daycare, we had to make a switch quickly. Kids & Company was our obvious choice — the director and teachers put our worries at ease. They even let us do a free trial to make sure it was a good fit for our one-year-old son before we registered. They let the daycare do the talking instead of just telling us what we wanted to hear. We were so happily surprised by the attention and care given to our son, who is quite sensitive. We get face-to-face updates at the end of the day as well as throughout. They really care about letting us know how our son is doing and making sure we’re happy with how they’re handling his care. Our little guy loves playing with his new friends and has a blast every day! Can’t recommend this centre enough.",

My boys have been attending since 2017 and we could not be happier. The staff turnover is very low,  the leadership team is clearly strong, everyone is responsive to your needs as a parent and your children's. Love the ability to log on anytime to take a peek at what kids are up to, the food, the fact that it isn't one big open space but rooms are divided by actual walls. You receive reports throughout the day about activities, sleep time, potty times etc. The fact that the parking is underground and K&Company have reserved spots (free) for pick up and drop off is a real perk - especially in the winter.\n\nThe staff are like family for my kids and we will certainly miss them all when my kids go to full time school. I will say it is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for. I would not hesitate in recommending this place to family and friends.",

Our children love their teachers and quite often give hugs to them upon arrival.  They have made many friends and their staff are very cognizant in ensuring there is enough staff for each class to adequately attend to the children.  We unfortunately have to move our children to another daycare to accommodate our eldest's kindergarten commencing shortly and I am sure they (along with their parents) will miss all of the great staff and friends they have met.   I can assure you the lower star reviews are not a true representation of this particular location.

I enroll my kids in this daycare because was on front of the school.\nThis was July 2019, Chloe, the director email me the prices and how much it will be starting on September after the yearly price adjustment and summer break time. On September, the amount withdraw from my account was higher that agreed so I asked what happened. By that time, the director was Tam and she asked me for the emails.\nI sent all the emails exchanged with Chloe stating the price and she reply that was a mistake from the previous director and accounting agreed to do a 1 time discount, but they couldn't respect the price given.\nWell, on December 3rd I was notified at 7pm by Jackie Winter, Senior Are Manager that the center will close on December 13th and they will transfer all the kids to a different one, 20 min away from that one. A daycare that has been running for 20+ years, no caring for the problems this would carry.\nAs there are no other daycares that work with my kids school, we agreed.\nOn January 30 I gave my 1 month notice to take my kids to somewhere else as the distance is killing our days. Next day we receive a call asking what they could do for us to keep the kids in the center, that they could offer us a great discount, but honestly, the distance is stronger than the money, so we refuse.\n2 days later, Jackie email me saying I'm owning them money the Subsidy didn't cover in October.\nI not even have subsidy...I forwarded her all the emails of why I do got a one time discount and she never replies.\nNow my kids are somewhere else, I'm receiving emails trying to charge me this mystery amounts.\nI tried to call the main office in Ontario and no one answer ever, the current site director (because no one seem to last over 3 months) said she want me to send all the emails again.\n\nPlease avoid the headache, this franchise is so poorly managed and they close the daycare no caring for the effect on the kids or parents.\nMy friend in BC had the same situation, they close a center from one day to another.",

They have open door bathroom policy which means kids all see each other when one of them is in the toilet. Isnt it privacy violation? I told them i was teaching my kid privacy and she needs to close the door and the manager said she will come with a solution by the end of the week but nothing has been done. Also most of the time my daughter came home starving. I was bringing food with me so she can eat some in car. And when i mentioned this they said they cant force kids to eat. And one day her lips were so dry and i asked didnt she have any water? And she said she asked for it but she couldn't get and I checked with teacher and she said there was a construction in the building so they couldnt use the waters. So my poor kid couldnt drink a sip of water all day and she was dehydrated.It is the worst worst worst daycare/ school i've ever seen.\nOnly good thing teacher Rose is nice.",

We brought them up to the director and she was FANTASTIC. She took our concerns very seriously and acted immediately on them to correct them. She also kept me informed throughout the process.\nWe also brought a concern up to the assistant director about the angle of the camera and how we couldn't see a corner of the classroom very well. She immediately looked at it and corrected it while I was there.\nNow what we see is fantastic staff engaging with my daughter and the children in her classroom.\nI used to be worried as a first time mom leaving my daughter in the hands of strangers as I didn't know what level of care she would receive but I do not worry anymore. I know she is in GREAT hands. It shows by the enthusiasm my daughter has when she comes to this place.\nMy daughter used to cling to me and cry when I tried to pass her off to the teacher, because it was a new experience for her, but now she almost jumps out of my arms to go to the teacher, Joy or Claudia when I drop her off! She sometimes even waves goodbye to me, which makes me very happy to see she is comfortable with the ladies there!\nYou can tell all of the staff love the children that go there, that its not just a job to them. The staff know all the childrens names as they pass in the hall, whether they are in the same classroom or not.\nWe are even buying a house in the same area (even though we wanted to go further south) so that we didn't have to find a new daycare.\nI highly recommend this daycare!!",

They are also the most expensive after school OSC, they charged $650 for my 3rd grader.\nMy kids went here for 2 months and I only received 2 updates about their daily activities.\nMy younger son came home with an injury twice and I never received any information from the daycare about the injuries.

        "text": "I had wonderful experience. Highly recommend Kids3 daycare. Owner and staff are awesome and very friendly. Love the diversity of kids and staff here. My little one started going at the age of 18 months and now he is 3 years old. Never had any concerns or issues. Always felt like I am sending my little one to his another family where all the staff work very hard and take care of kids so much. My son love to go there everyday and I had to wait for him when I pick him up as he doesn’t wanted to leave his daycare and love to play there. Recently we moved to a different place and that was the only reason I had to change the daycare. Otherwise I would have never changed as he was so much used to and love his teachers. He still says his teachers name at home. Thank you to everyone for taking care of my little one. Special thanks to Sohaila, Avneet and Harleen for your hard work and love towards the kids.",

I have been through this daycare for five years with my first son and now since 6 months with my second son. They are absolutely phenomenal, always treating my kids as their own. When we moved from the city into Sherwood park I still drive my kid to this daycare because of the trust, reliability and love I have for them. A daycare should make you feel comfortable and treat your children like a family away from home, the director teacher Param has always gone above and beyond for our family when needed. Teachers Melani and Cathy have been nurturing and always informing me of changing situations with my youngest babe. A big thanks to them helping our kids grow.",

        "text": "My daughter has been going going to Kinder Campus for nearly two years now. Our original goal had been to find something a bit closer to home once we moved to the south side (it's a 45 min commute every morning), but that simply isn't an option anymore. The reasons are numerous, but it really boils down to the fact that while many daycares and dayhomes portray themselves as having a family environment, Kinder Campus is the family that we want our family to be.\n\nThe staff are not just caring - they are passionate about creating the safest, most nourishing space possible for every child in their care. From private, personalized blog posts about our daughter that are almost mini novels in length to stacks of art projects every month to things like \"international mud day\" and \"Batman day\", I firmly believe that no one else would be able to care for my daughter the way that this daycare has - even myself.\n\nI guess I'm writing this review now because when we were looking around for prospective daycares, I must admit that Kinder Campus was not even on my radar. There are many daycares in Edmonton after all, and as I tend to shop for products and services via reviews, I didn't even notice this one. However, my wife had heard great things from two of her friends, and ended up spending half a day at the daycare just observing the staff's interaction with our daughter and the other children. She had done the same vetting process with multiple other daycares by this point, and she immediately knew that Kinder Campus was the one. Now, after having the pleasure of interacting nearly daily with Hanne, Debra, Danielle, Jezelle and all the other great people at Kinder Campus for the past couple of years, I can't imagine trusting my daughter with anyone else. So if any prospective parents happen upon this review, do your child a favor and take the time to personally visit Kinder Campus and compare with the other daycares. You won't regret it!",

My son had a rough transition to daycare including lots of crying, refusing to be held by staff and not eating for the first few days. Agnes and the staff were so patient and genuinely caring with him despite all this. Two weeks later he made amazing progress. The owner Nadia is amazing as well. She helps out in the baby room each morning, knows all the kids by name and I've seen the kids say they love her. Nadia and Agnes truly love what they do and it shows. You will not be disappointed with this wonderful daycare.",

Mine are the following.\n\nBetween August 2022 - March 2023, I have called 14 times:\n\n12 calls rang until disconnected (no voicemail)\n\n1 call answered by Admin staff letting us know Fatima would be contacting us within the next 48hrs. - no return call\n\n2 calls answered by Fatima\n1/10/23 - Fatima let us know that they aren't aware of the status of our position but will follow up in 48hrs. - no follow up\n1/16/23 - Fatima let us know that they aren't aware of the status of our position but will follow up in 48hrs. - no follow up\n\n1/26/23 - A voicemail was left from La Petite Academy Childcare Centre that was inaudible due to their phone reception. We called back and left a voicemail. - no follow up received.\n\nIf the facility, program and services explained on our tour were met, this would be a great option. The communication between La Petite Academy Childcare Centre to my family has been very stressful and frustrating.",

Both kids were very happy to be there, and it was a tough day for all of us when my daughter aged out of the program (when she started grade 1). During their time at LaPetite, my children were extremely content - always happy to go to daycare each day, excited to see their friends and teachers, and always coming home with crafts, fun stories of adventures, new songs and french words! I loved the innovative use of their HiMama app, which provided updates throughout the day in the form of photos and staff communication.\nI trusted the staff at LaPetite so completely, and always felt very confident my children were in good hands. I would have kept my children there longer if I could have.\nWe miss you, LaPetite!",

They always lied about what happen probably because they never paid attention. My daughters only attended this daycare 2 months. I pulled them out because I had picked up my daughter and noticed a huge gash on my daughters forehead. I completely seen red! On their incident report it says it’s a scratch which I got confirmation from a doctor that it was in fact a wound and not a scratch. My older daughter said she was pushed and hit her head and blood was pouring from her head. I asked the daycare why her jacket she wore to daycare was wet and they said “she threw it in the water” turns out they were attempting to wash the blood out of her jacket. They did so basic first aid and my partner nor myself was notified. On the report says it happened at 2:30 we picked her up at 5:45pm. HER PARENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD!!! Incompetent people watching other peoples kids. I am amazed people are trusting them with their children. They will allow anyone to be a daycare worker these days. If I could post pictures I would of all the evidence I have of this horrible daycare!",

As a mother and a psychologist with over 15 years of experience (which includes advanced training at the University of Alberta, a competitive and accredited program) I would highly recommend this daycare. Our experience with teacher Rebecca was more than we could ask for. Our daughter is a strong willed and sensitive child, and it can take a lot of time for her to warm up to someone. She immediately established a bond with Rebecca. She is no longer in that classroom, and she will tell us every week she wants to be in teacher Rebecca room. Over the years I observed Rebecca create a safe space (physical and emotional), while also developing an age appropriate curriculum. My child has learned so much from Rebecca and we are grateful for that. Recently there have been some concerning reviews about Rebecca that are not consistent with my experience or the other parents I have talked to. Professionally speaking, I disagree that this daycare would lead to childhood trauma. This is a reputable daycare with over ten years of the same management. This daycare has seen repeat customers and many families find their way there through word of mouth. Finding a child care provider is one of the biggest decisions you will make as a parent. I hope in addition to looking at online reviews, you will talk to the owner, staff and other parents when making this decision. I would be happy to talk to anyone that is curious about this business from a parent perspective but also a child development perspective.",

Would not recommend if your child is full of energy. My son got sick lots of times, outbreaks of lice and came home with a full diaper and dirty hands and face. Not a good experience for my family. Also they admitted to locking my son in a stroller because they were unable to watch him. Why label your daycare as one that helps kids on the spectrum and say you can accept my children then kick them out. While I’m at work, going home making supper and cleaning up. My son was at the daycare being locked up in stroller. I will have trust issues after this and not trust anyone with my children again.",

Left the school because of the disrespectful and incoherent students and teachers, switching from my past school to Laurier made a downfall on my education.. started failing because the teachers never cared about what they were saying and always sped through the classes so you wouldn’t have any idea of what they were talking about.. students would play with their vapes & watch inappropriate videos in class and they never even cared, got yelled at from a teacher and the principal over throwing jolly ranchers to a friend.. JOLLY RANCHERS!! Overall sour attitude from everyone and terrible environment to have your children in this school. 0/10 do not recommend this school for your kids mental health and education towards their future. (French immersion students are rude and they think they are better than the other students just because they talk another language, like miss girl we learn French too babes). Switched to the catholic system and it’s 10x better than this school will ever be",

His lack of understanding, compassion and desire to learn what works best for individual children learning needs and abilities is just not there. Numerous parent teacher conversations and zero results towards change. \"Beating a dead horse.\" All my children started at Laurier Heights from kindergarten in the French Immersion program and the bullying was prominent. Issues were never appropriately handled and swept under the rug. We chose to have our one child transfer from Laurier Heights in grade 7 do to constant bullying (causing mental health struggles) and a HUGE lack of option classes. Understand- there is NO technology class, a multi purpose library, NO construction and fabrication, NO cosmetology, NO costume design and the foods class that Laurier Heights does offer is very small and limits the kids ability to excel. I strongly encourage you to reconsider this school, there is a VERY good reason why their reviews are this low!",

We put my daughter in another daycare before that but within a week, we pulled her out and then I came across Learned Robin Montessori. Fast forward to 3 1/2 years later and still counting; both of my girls go to LRM and we have never had an issue with the way the daycare is run. The staff is really compassionate and patient towards the kids, Razia has a natural nurturing and motherly personality. She knows details about each child and she treats everyone like one big happy family.\nRecently I took my youngest daughter who just turned 3 for a preschool program screening and she didn't qualify because she was well above the developmental scale. This just assured me that LRM not only does an amazing job with caring for my children, but they also do a thorough job with teaching my kids. My eldest will be starting kinder in the fall but we plan to keep her there for after school care as well.\nBring your kids here!! You will not be disappointed at all.",

I don't need to defend myself or go into any more details, but this response is EXACTLY another reason why my children no longer attend this daycare.  3 years was enough to try and work it out and improve things.\nSimply unprofessional,\n\nI am very disappointed with Learning Hands Daycare. Rather than console or talk to a child who is having a difficult time, they take their phones out and start recording them which is enough to make anyone angrier. Nothing can justify them to record a child for this reason, I did not consent to that. This happened on many occasions and more than 1 child.  They also threatened me that moving forward, I would have to pick up my child in the middle of the day because they could not handle them around nap time as they don't have enough staff to separate kids who sleep, away from older kids who don't. By threatening me to pick them up, they are no longer guaranteeing me or providing the care that I paid them for.\nLearning Hands Daycare is extremely unprofessional. They do not take any accountability. Look at any of the negative reviews and you will see they are always redirecting issues and blame to the families who have concerns.\nI would NEVER send a child or recommend this place.",

In addition to overworking me, the director underpaid me. The daycare had a problem hiring people without experience or with some experience, some thought it was easy. As a childcare professional, I have completed childcare level 2, WHMIS, and safety training. Later on, I found out from two employers that I was fired for calling a daycare license on the director, when I didn't. Some parents complain about some of the staff's ability to care for children. Make sure you check in on your child or children by showing up unannounced. I had to also remove my daughter from there because the out of school employ couldn't handle a child with special needs.",

I tried pulling my kids a few times, but they promised they would work with them as again \"they have a teacher who is trained\". Either that's a lie, or they need to take a different course. I started getting really upset after every single day it was a new problem, and I was made to feel like it was my fault. I am at work and putting my trust in staff to keep my kids safe amd know what to do. They are kids who need a little extra help, but unfortunately the daycare just doesn't understand that.

Absolutely amazing teachers, my son never wanted to leave, he’d try and hide when i showed up to stay longer! My 4 year old, would talk about her teachers at home all the time. She still plays ‘teacher’ at home and uses her teachers names.\n\nThe director is so kind and considerate. Only reason we left was i started mat leave, I will 100% only go here when I'm ready to go back to work.\n\nP.S my kids miss everyone here ❤️",

They provide lots of outside time, fun crafts, and good food. My son feels comfortable and happy when I take him there and is happy when I pick him up. All the staff and management is approachable, willing to hear concerns, and provide follow-ups when required. I would definitely recommend Little Learners.\n\nA follow up note on this review: My family was very happy with Little Learners for quite a while but in September of 2019 we decided to leave because of a high turnover in staff. My son had four new room teachers in five months. This was especially difficult for him since he was potty training. The last teacher he had (Jess) was a lovely and dedicated teacher but was ultimately set up to fail by the managers by pairing her with many different assistants who were not up to the task of teaching or associating busy toddlers.\nWe ended up having to find another daycare when my husband showed up to drop our son off on September 3rd and did not know any of the child care providers in my son's room. We were later told by management that his teacher was burnt out and moved to a different room and that the teacher should have told us that she was moving. It was not uncommon for the teachers to look absolutely exhausted at the end of the day.\nJess, did everything should could to help our son transition to potty train at daycare but it was not a success.\nMy husband and I were no longer comfortable leaving our son there with such a high turnover of staff. Our September fees were taken out of our account that day and were never returned.",

I understand that working in a day care can be tedious but the teacher Mira was rude  when I asked her not to wake up my child during nap time even when I come to pick her up. I suggested that I can always come back when she wakes up but she was not having it .She woke my child up 15 minutes into her nap! My baby woke up crying on the way home and stressed.

As a returning parent, our full registration fee was waved and I found this is the best daycare that parents can rely on. I am glad that my kid is in a good hand. I would highly recommend this daycare to any parent.",

I went in for a tour and the owners seemed amazing so I decided to enroll her. Within days I knew I made the right decision. Anita who works in the baby room is absolutely amazing and my daughter adores her. Such wonderful and attentive staff and I am soo happy with my decision. Going back to work with a baby is so tough but they made it so easy for me and I really feel like she is in such good hands there! Thank you for looking after my pride and joy with such care!",

I am pleased with the little staff turn over as there are some “original” staff from when we started. The location is excellent with easy access to parking which makes drop off quick and easy. For being downtown the monthly fee is very reasonable. Security is great as you need a scan card. The facility is brightly painted and has a wonderful outdoor play area for being downtown, that was one of the main attractions for me as a parent. Recently, I’ve asked staff to not let my daughter sleep at nap time due to difficulty putting her down at bedtime. They seem to be following my directions which I am pleased with. My daughter has developed and learned so much in her 3 years at this daycare which will definitely prepare her for kindergarten!\n\nI would recommend this daycare to other parents.",

As a parent, it gives you a sense of relief knowing that your children are taken care of even in your absence.\nFor younger one I tried two other places and even nanny before Lux and at both he used to cry so much that he would get sick and with nanny i would still have to pitch in with everything. But things changed with lux, from second day I could sense that he will settle in here and now he is even has his afternoon nap there which is truly big for us.\nI would confidently recommend Lux Daycare to any parent....",

We found out that we would be in Edmonton for several months while we awaited the birth of our second child. Mama Roza's was recommended to us by a nurse at the RAH and I went to meet with Esta (Mama Roza's daughter) and immediately fell in love with the space and the compassion shown to me and my family. Not only were they extremely understanding and accommodating, they have created a wonderful community and familial atmosphere of caring and respect (a quick message out to the community and they helped me get a playpen for my daughter so she had somewhere to sleep at oir AirBnB). My daughter absolutely loves the daycare, which is incredible, themed curriculum that is shared with parents in advance that includes experiential learning amd STEM activities (which as an educator is a huge plus in my books) and freshly prepared healthy meals and snacks daily by their in-house chef. Every one of their staff I have interacted with are both knowledgeable and professional (Huge thank you to Esta and Ruth for going above and beyond to support us) and treat my daughter as their own. If you are in Edmonton and are looking for childcare or know someone who is, I highly recommend Mama Roza's. Thank you for being so amazing.\nMichael Small",

        "text": "This review is for the south side location. I’ve had the pleasure of sending 2 of my children from 12 months old all the way through to OSC care up to grade 3 and pre-school. I made a surprise visit when first considering this daycare and they served healthy veggie snacks and the director was also hands on & they gladly gave me the grand tour. I was lucky there was no waiting list at the time either. Their pricing is competitive and, I dare say more affordable than some others. They were excellent at offering tips on how to reduce separation anxiety at drop offs when we first started and as my kids developed, they had communication sheets/ books so I could read on the progress and they posted photos on the walls so I didn’t feel like I was missing out ( I work full time). They staff are great at communication and were always quick to call if my child was ill or if an incident happened with another child, their follow up processes are excellent. They post everything too, everything from audits, fire drill results, if there was COVID exposures (rare), first aid qualified staff, resources for parents, and even what the daily menus are for the kids (I really appreciated how they served healthy meals and hot lunches). Their programs offerings are excellent and included other fun things like kid yoga, and even Zumba at one point. They’ve had community guest speakers like police and firemen, and even did neighborhood field trips to the seniors centre & the grocery store pre-pandemic and did Halloween trick or treating with the shops on the same strip mall. They also do outdoor walks, trips to the playground and even silver berry park/playground sometimes. Their teaching programs in general are fantastic, my youngest learned the names of continents through song at age 4 and the special days like teddy bear picnics, or multicultural days are fun & taught my kids about ethnic traditions re: my eldest had learned a Punjabi kids rhyme (we’re not Punjabi), and they learned about Diwali, Chinese New Year, etc. We opted for the summer camp preschool program this year while my youngest transitioned to a new daycare within the school she’s starting at this fall and MMSSCDC did direct pick up & drop off with her for their day amp program. I feel like this daycare has been like a second parent to my children and they have raised them so well. It’s a little bittersweet having to leave, we just found it more convenient for a direct drop off and pick up at their school for OSC who are open just a little bit earlier and closed later, even though I feel the service is not up to par and not as good a value compared to MMSSCDC (now called scholastic). If and when I have another child, MMSSCDC will definitely be the top choice for daycare in my books!!",

I see the endless amount of toys and am doubtful proper toy cleaning is being executed.  After an arduous few weeks of contacting daycares, the tone of the response given to me upon my inquiry was cold, short with no provision of additional or helpful information. Not to mention a highly disturbing amount of grammatical errors, which raises red flags as to the legitimacy of any business.  Furthermore, a week waiting for a follow up to my other questions is absolutely unacceptable.",

Our son started when he was 6 months old from infant room and has moved up to the toddler room recently.\n\nIt is not easy to leave your child at daycare for the first time, especially when they are so young, but soon enough we got peace of mind that he was receiving the best care.\n\nAll of the educators have been so lovely with him, and so enthusiastic to see him every morning. I love how MCE childcare is so proactive about planning thoughtful and educational activities every day, and I also love how they provide such a healthy well-balanced menu for lunches and snacks.\n\nYes, there is always room for improvement but they are so dedicated to improve proactively. Especially the Director Benazir is impeccably hard-working and passionate about this childcare. The director is an exceptional lead and a true asset to our community. She brought together some amazing teachers who are so caring and welcoming.\n\nWe’re overwhelmed with the level of care, professionalism and quality of early learning the MCE Childcare team provides.",

Looking at the way they handle and manage kids, I decided to put my younger one to this daycare when she was 1 year old.  The facility is clean, well-maintained, and regularly sanitized. They keep checking your kids development regularly. They are always open to answering our questions and addressing any concerns promptly. The staff is caring, attentive, and truly dedicated to the well-being and development of the children in their care. They provide the report by the end of the day. Looking at the pictures and videos they send is always exciting.\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend MCE daycare to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and enriching environment for their child.",

Instead it's been a battle trying to get in touch with literally anyone from this facility. They don't answer their phones or respond to voicemails, they do not respond to emails, facebook messages... The one time I managed to call and actually get through to a person, there was no professional greeting or \"thank you for calling McLeod Day Care\" just a \"hello?\"\n\nAny parent who is concerned for their child's wellbeing would probably find it distasteful how bad at communication this facility is. If I have to buy, train and employ a carrier pigeon to get in contact with this facility, then you probably aren't a good place to put a small child.\n\nEither way, I was very disappointed, as were other parents I had talked to who had similar experiences.

Me and my wife had been looking for a daycare for our little one for almost over a month around north side of edmonton. We looked at couple of places  around and we where not happy with most of them until we came across this daycare. Helen, the owner and director of  Moms dream daycare took her time to explain and showed us around. She walked us through their amazing program plan for the children. During the tour, the kids kept on coming up to her and the staff members for a random hugs. We could tell how passionate Helen and the workers were. The interaction was unbelievable. The children seemed very happy. It wasn't easy finding the right daycare for our boy ,but now we can finally say we found the right place. Our son loves the daycare from the moment we went to see it, he didn't want to leave the daycare when we went the first time to see it. All I want to say is, Thank you Helen what an amazing place you created for these children, keep up the good work !",

The staff are so skilled at teaching the children in a structured, yet nurturing and playful manner. Our boys developed a strong foundation for reading, printing, arithmetic, science, and the arts--may it be visual, musical, or theatrical. The staff also a ensure that children have ample physical play and they provide the children with a variety of activities such a dance, yoga, swimming, and sportball for developing gross and fine motor skills. The staff also make it a priority to teach the children (and their families) about a variety of cultures, and they take pride in celebrating the lovely diversity that we have within our city and country. And best of all, our children still \"got to be kids\".\n\nThe staff are very transparent, and are always trying to evolve the program with input from parents/caregivers.\n\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, Mrs. Lambert (director) and her staff were extremely conscientious with their infection control precautions and the safety of the children and their families; the quality of teaching and play never waivered even for a moment during this stressful time. This allowed me and my husband to continue working in the front lines of healthcare during the pandemic, for which we are ever so grateful.\n\nI only wish that the centre could continue to teach my kids beyond the kindergarten years!

Karen has a safe space for children to play, rest, learn, grow, make friends, feel loved & nurtured.\n\nOur story of coming to Morning Glory:\nOur dayhome closed its doors end of May, I was looking for a place for my son, he just turned two. And I had driven past Morning Glory a number of times, and was intrigued. I went in and met Karen. She showed me around, inquired about my children and told me about her vision for her child care center. Upon meeting Karen I could tell that she has a gentle, loving nature & her eyes light up when she sees the children. I felt at ease in her presence. The first few weeks my son cried when I dropped him off (obviously, 🥴🥺). Morning Glory uses an APP to share photos and updates of each child personally to the parent. This was extremely helpful in easing MY comfort. Now that my son has been attending Morning Glory for 5 months, we have noticed an increase in his language skills, his confidence is up and when I drop him off he says ‘BYE MAMA’ and excitedly joins his friends! (The crying at drop off is few and far between hooray!)\n\nKaren has put together an amazing meal plan, play activities and learning. The children enjoy outside play 2 times a day (in good weather). There is an enclosed play area out back that is super fun!\nI feel supported in the growth and development of my son, but also in my own journey as a mother.\n\nIf you are touched by our story, please get in touch with Karen. I am confident you will find a home here for your child!",

We were referred by friends and family that had their kids enrolled and loved it, and we continue to refer our friends and family. We interviewed a couple other well known daycares in the area and as a mom I immediately felt a connection and sense of trust with the staff at My Daycare. These amazing women have become like family and we trust them 100% with our babies! They treat the kids like their own. I also love that my girls are exposed to a mix of cultures and language at My Daycare. The staff are so incredibly loving, accommodating and very professional. The same staff have been there for the three years we’ve been enrolled which says a lot about the management and environment. Many have been there much longer. Our daughters learn manners, social skills, hygiene, rules, kindergarten prep and have so much fun with so many creative activities! Some of the parents are teachers themselves and have raved about the learning program at My Daycare as well. I also love the outdoor space and large windows. The kids get lots of time outside in the nicer months and lots of natural light on the days the weather doesn’t allow for outdoor play. I can’t say enough about this daycare and feel it’s incredible underrated.",

We could tell he was loved and well care off as he rarely cried at drop-off and instead ran to play with cars. There was also always a teacher available to greet him with toys, food or hugs (what ever he needed). At pick up you could always see him having fun. The daycare is organized and have daily planned activities, you get updates of pictures of your child and I could see him enjoying a yoga, painting, water games, sand games, etc. I think they have a really good time there, and staff are very kind and well prepared to look after your child.",

She would give me field trip forms for 3 of my children ONLY 1 day in advance and would rush me to sign and pay her. Most times asking for $60 for one field trip. My children didn't go on any field trip due to my lack of prior knowledge and insufficient time for planning and budgeting.\n\nMy children lasted 11 days in the daycare. I had enough of her verbal abuse and horrible attitude towards me and my children's step-father. I thought to myself, \"If this woman can yell in my face, give me the cold shoulder when trying to talk about issues and make me feel totally disrespected, it made me wonder how she treats my precious children?\"\n\nI give this daycare center 1 star because even the management condones their staff members behavior and attitude! If you are a parent and searching for child care, please trust your gut instinct when choosing someone to care for your babies when you can't be present. It is important and can be detrimental to their health and growth if not cautious about your child care providers.",

The women there was extremely rude to me and used racial words I ignored her but I have now realised what she said I can not keep quiet otherwise someone else will experience what I went through. i’m not afraid to mention these staff members name harman and anju so unprofessional staff",

The care factor they show not towards just the kids but to ensure that the parents are at ease when they drop the kids is amazing.  The  programs they provide are so much fun as well as a very diiferent approach to the learning experience for kids.......my favourite is the role play.

The level of care and attention my daughter received at Precious Sprouts was unmatched and completely blew me away, and all of the staff was so easy to work with through different transitions. I always felt as though no matter the situation, there was always love and acceptance here. It honestly really felt like it gave off \"home\" vibes, and I was sad to say goodbye to this wonderful daycare when we moved.

Primrose is in a new facility custom built for them located on the main floor of a seniors facility...no more run down care facilities or functionally delinquent space for them! The kids love the staff; the parents love the facility! The added bonus is that as a not for profit organization, part of Primrose’s values is its involvement as a resource centre for all families in the area.",

        "text": "If I could give 0 stars I would.\n\nI registered my son in the mountain adventure camp, and have had nothing but problems with the staff out of progressive . The director and staff in the mountains were amazing, but the people you will deal with are the staff at progressive and they have made the experience horrific.\n\nAlthough they managed to accept our $1800 dollars immediately, their welcome package wasn't even filled out with the program name or my child's name. We were never sent a course outline, or a who to contact if things go wrong email. And boy oh boy, did they ever cause things to go wrong.\nEmails and voice mails were not returned, no one bothered to respond to confirm requested information was received.\nSomehow, despite me having repeatedly brought attention to issues with the online course access since July 2nd ( it is now August 20th) to Lisa, Charmaine, Sarah in IT, Sarah the director, the general office staff ( with no less than 20 emails and more voice-mails ) not ONCE did one person pull up his file and double checked his information . They registered hi. In the wrong class. As a  result my son spent the summer doing 80 plus hours of work he shouldn't have had to do, and an entire course he shouldn't have had access to.\n\nAll of progressives staff, from director downward have been made aware, and not one person has offered apology or explanation.\nThat should tell you about the respect they have for the students and parents they have under their care.\n\nThat have shown zero remorse, zero accountability, zero respect for the fact that despite charging me for the most expensive option, despite having multiple levels of staff aware of the issue for 6 weeks, not one person of 10 who was made aware of the problem tried to fix it, take ownership, do basic fact checking or offer even the vaguest of apologies.  They couldn't even return an email. Not once.\n\nIn fact, despite the course deadline being TOMORROW, they have not even returned a call or email to let us know how to proceed.\nMy son was supposed to do 3 units online. Instead he has done over 60. He was granted access to the 3 units 2 days ago.\n\nI am absolutely gob smacked by the lack of professionalism, by the absolute ineptitude at all levels .\n\nIf you care about your children, avoid progressive academy.  They do not seem to understand their role as educators. There is no transparency, no one to contact when there is an issue. They do not care about wasting a kids summer, or the fact we have spent 2 months trying to get a problem they set in motion solved.\n\nMy child is an extremely high achiever, attending public school, where this would never happen. This school is about as progressive or success focused as a school teaching creationism out of an Atco trailer.  All they want is your money .",

        "text": "My review specifically focuses on the current PA Pre-K program. Initially, the program was excellent - until 2021, but unfortunately, it has experienced a significant decline since then, coinciding with the appointment of Kayla as the new program director. In my experience, Kayla has demonstrated a lack of respect towards parents and has shown a tendency to label the children, which is concerning and has had a negative impact on the program.\n\nOne incident, in particular, greatly bothered me. There was a safety issue involving a child requiring emergency assistance, and instead of addressing the situation appropriately and providing feedback to parents regarding safety improvements, Kayla dismissed it as an accident. Furthermore, she displayed an aggressive and impolite attitude when discussing minor mistakes made by the children with their parents. This behavior only exacerbated the situation and left us with the impression that she enjoys creating unnecessary trouble for parents (I don't want to say, but it is very Karen.)\n\nMoreover, I have reservations about Kayla's educational background and qualifications to manage a team of highly educated teachers. While the program's teachers remain commendable, hiring an underqualified director like Kayla reflects poorly on the reputation of the PA Pre-K program and makes it less appealing to parents. We enrolled our children in the PA Pre-K program because we believed it offered more than a regular daycare program. If Kayla only has experience as a daycare provider and lacks experience working in childcare or school management teams, it raises concerns about her communication skills, experience in dealing with young children, and fair and sound approach to addressing incidents and behavior problems.\n\nDue to the negative experiences we encountered with Kayla, we made the decision to withdraw our younger child from the program. Unless there is a change in leadership and Kayla is replaced, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the PA Pre-K program to any of my friends or local community. It is my hope that the program promptly addresses these issues for the sake of its students and the community's perception of its reputation.",

They don’t listen to you they talk over you they do a lot of promises never deliver, even though they charge premium $$$ for the school. The teachers over there are highly qualified no complains about them. I have three children in there already, but the administrative part of the school is unprofessional, unhelpful, and it feels they really never on same page when you talk to them. for example, the administration staff give their own children and their friends’ children, and their relatives’ children more attention discounts extra care etc. Meanwhile, for other kids treatment is totally different, their own kids can swear, be rude, even hit the teachers, but other kids should be perfect, even tho all my kids are well respectful kids yet it feels unfair for the rest of the kids to be treated differently, I only wish the owners of the school can investigate deep into that. Administrative honestly is the worst in anything I have ever dealt with in any kind of services in anything, since these people became in it. The hypocrisy is very obvious. We pay $$$ you don’t care about little kids who might need a little bit of help but your own administrative staff not teachers have special treatment if this is not tyranny I dunno what tyranny is. Also classes been totally big so not much attention to each student as it used to be before.",

They had my daughter reading at a grade 12 reading comprehension level when she was in kindergarten. They had amazing talent opportunities and did not spent school money on their benefit. They used it for helping students in their education endeavours. They also have mixed children which was the reason I found them in the first place. My children are half Asian, my son looks full Asian. And tempo was high rated but all a bunch of white children. I felt my son would feel out of place and I didn’t like that. I love progressive for having such a race mix the children were all amazing, the field trips were so awesome. The school doesn’t leave any child behind, leaves no gaps in knowledge, they have payment plans for monthly payments instead of yearly tradition. My children learned and took a lot from this school with them to bring them success in life.",

They had no structure, kids were absolutely all over the place, having tablets in the ball pit area. A child had peed themselves and he was never changed and continued playing with pee in his pants. Kids were eating on the floor and rolling around on the floor. If I would be a parent and I saw this, I would’ve been very disappointed.",

Other kids behaviour/reaction: As a mom, my first checkpoint is to see how other kids act in the daycare because kids don't lie. Kids are all happy, energetic and friendly in daycare. There are not much tears and sickness happened around there.\n\n2. Staff: John & Patty are awesome! They are caring, responsible and kind to all kids and I can tell kids loves them a lot. Both of them are very responsive to my questions and concern, that provides an ease of mind for me as a parent both work full time. Other staffs are great in daycare and show good care to kids.\n\n3. Environment/Meal: The area is spacious and clean for kids to have activity around the daycare during cold days, and it has an outdoor playground with sandpit (attached next to the building). I like the outdoor playground because it is NOT an extension to the parking lot/drive way, which gives me peace of mind when my boy plays outdoor. My son loves hot lunch and snack provided and that they even offer fried rice once a week.\n\n4. Extra activities during summer: John organizes weekly outdoor activities during summer and my son loves them so much (such as park visits, special events @ WEM, etc).\n\nMy boy went to other daycare before and I can see how difference he is in love with Red Apple. I hope this comment can help parent in search of daycare around Belmed area. :)",

Initially I didn’t realize that RSOSC actually has two locations with one being at Richard Secord School and the other being at the Enjoy Life Church making it much closer to my child’s school of Greenfield. The staff at RSOSC are professional, attentive, caring and creative. It’s very typical for my child to come home with a variety of crafts and on days when the school is closed for PD days etc. the caregivers typically plan extra fun activities and theme days such as karaoke, henna, talent shows, tie-dying, Hawaiian day, Denim day, baking and more. During these challenging times of COVID the Executive Director, Jade, has been excellent at communicating the changing guidelines and seeking parent feedback through surveys. I’m so happy we stumbled upon this location last year and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for out of school care for their child.",

        "text": "An absolutely AMAZING place! We have sent all 3 of our children to Riverbend Montessori Child Development Centre over the last 8 YEARS!! We started them at Riverbend Montessori when they were 2 and 3. The staff, the atmosphere, play areas, and other children are wonderful. If you are looking for a new place to send your children, this place is EXCELLENT. Our children learned, played, and their social skills increased so well as they grew. We loved the field trips, bike days, activities, nature walks, park days, ice cream days, birthday celebrations, sledding, Christmas concerts, celebrations of all cultural events, and many creations our children made here. We especially loved the updates and photos  we would get of our children of their activities during the day. They especially helped our last child adjust to going to Riverbend Montessori so well. He would cry when I left him, most likely because I took an extended maternity leave and he’s my baby ! (He is super attached to me). But Teacher Mylene would always be there to comfort him, and ensure he felt safe and cared for. Our family will always be forever grateful to Pam, Mylene, Mama Sana, Shazia, Susan (who have been there from day 1), and all the Riverbend Montessori staff. They treated all our children like their own family.\n\nSide comment to the lady LB who only gave a one star rating because she didn’t want to pay the administration fee to hold a spot on the wait list. This DOES NOT reflect the quality of the business and does not justify one star. It takes a lot to maintain a business (the admin, planning, scheduling etc.). When you apply to the University of Alberta you have to pay an application fee to show you are SERIOUS to attend. Many places have an administrative fee. This is no different. If 100 people asked to be put on the wait list and only 30 were serious to attend, that adds up to a lot of time and energy calling people back and confirming a spot for them. If you just want a regular “daycare” with no fee, then that’s your choice. Go find one. But I can definitely say your child will not have the same  amazing care and experiences they would have received, if they had attended Riverbend Montessori. If you are serious, the admin fee is just a stepping stone to get your child into an AMAZING program, with amazing people, and other amazing children!",

Super friendly and responsible teachers, who are always available for questions and concerns. The center looks small from outside but is actually very decent in its indoor size, with very neat and tidy sections (open concept but kids are separated by age and grouped in different sections of the room). Kids are always busy with programs and activities and are never bored or left alone. New comers are cordially welcomed and very quickly make friends because all the kids there are so welcoming and nice! I've been through 3 daycares and this is just the best one. My son had been through a bad daycare before he joined Riverbend Montessori and this daycare is just a God-sent. I would definitely recommend it to anyone around the area looking for a daycare.",

My kids definitely have their favourites!\n\nI have recommended this a daycare to everyone and anyone who will listen to me!\nI work with kids myself and this facility is by far the best we’ve dealt with as a family!\n\nSo good that I even use one of the teachers as my babysitter on the weekends and evenings when needed!! Absolutely exceptional work and behaviour from these beautiful bunch of ladies!!\n\nForever Friends!\nLearning is Key!\nThey Make Learning Fun!",

Being in a daycare isn’t just all on daycare staff, it has a lot to do with the parent as well. Our attitude and how we deal with situations comes out in our children as we are the ones shaping their response mechanisms. Secord Childcare makes all children feel secure and wanted. We have been going here for just under two years and I would say that I feel comfortable that my kids are taken care of and loved just like their own.\n\nThe staff are nice, positive and are here to help all children grow.\n\nChildren’s emotions happen and frustration comes out of their little souls but I feel confident that the staff know how to handle the situation in a respectful and calming manner.\n\nThank you for taking care of my most precious things.",

        "text": "My daughter attended this childcare for one month. We left because she got to witness one child continuously hitting teachers. Scientific studies state that a witness to any form of violence can have the same emotional and physiological effect as being the victim themselves. This is not what our children should be subjected to. There were more excuses than solutions.\n\nFurther to this, there were a few times I walked into the room to no adult supervision this morning (and the last day of attendance) being one of those days. The teachers did not make a welcoming environment, and when this was addressed with the director, the greetings that were then expressed felt forced and more of a nuisance for the teachers than anything.\n\nMy daughter would end and start her day with a statement similar to, \"I don't want to go to the daycare.\" She is the kind of child that normally loves entering engaging and stimulating areas. Her previous childcare was a place of enjoyment and learning, along with plenty of physical activity. I do not recommend this childcare. We will be vetting childcares more thoroughly from now on. It looks nice, but looks can be deceiving.",

However, on the second morning my son refused to go back, as in, he undid his seatbelt, opened the car door and ran away down the street! It was like he was fighting for his life! I realize this probably speaks more to my sweet, gentle, sensitive son's difficulty adjusting than the daycare itself. But what irked me was that when I suggested doing a few days of gradually introducing my son to the daycare with me staying there with him, the owner would have none of it. She said I was only allowed to stay 15 minutes (even though in their handbook it says parents can stay for an hour to help their kid adjust)! When questioned about that, she said \"oh that's for younger kids\". My son is 3. She also had the audacity to insinuate that he was being disobedient and that I was not disciplining him enough. I was so mad. If you work in childcare, shouldn't you be concerned about the mental health of the children more than your arbitrary rules?! So, we couldn't go back.",

Any questions I had were answered right away in a professional manner. They also use himama so I can see what he was up to throughout the day, whether its food consumption,  diaper change, or even activities that they do along. If anyone is looking for a reasonably priced daycare with a great play based education system, I would highly recommend this place",

Instead they attempt to handle them and wrap thin blankets on the outside. If I was a parent of these children I would immediately take them out of your care. I hope you will take this opportunity to revamp your safety drill. Consider taking them into the church beside as the rest of the school does instead of leaving them in the freezing cold.",

So, I witnessed the whole situation. I saw the staff handled the situation professionally. They waited there till the headcount was over to make sure their responsibility of every child is out of the situation. As head count would had been over, they would have proceeded to church with rest of school. Staff showed presence of mind to pick up blankets to keep kids warm. I saw two of Staff  I name them Ms. N and Ms. J provided their jackets to kids because they were on their lunch break so they had their jackets on. The owner she generally keeps three  big blankets in her car for such situations but before we could have gone to it  this situation was over and everyone went in. I am leaving the review thinking that it is not fair to  staff who were diligent on their duties. Staff prepared warm chocolate milk for kids as soon as they were in. I rate staff is very friendly and professional.I would suggest if their is any concern, please bring into the notice of Ms. S (Owner) she takes care of everything without any delay and I am sure any constructive suggestion will not be ignored.",

Most of the educators are friendly and seem quite engaged with the children. They also do many different crafts and activities like finger painting, pom pom art, circle time, and zumba. The center director is kind, caring and responsive to our questions. We also enjoy the daily updates and photos/videos that the educators send us. Our kiddo comes home clean too! No muddy shoes or dirty/missing clothes like my friends' kids at other daycares. Meals are healthy and include food from different food groups. I can tell that the staff take great care in keeping our kiddo healthy and their belongings clean.\n\nEven though our experience with Star Learners is positive, I'm only giving 4 stars because of the following: front doors aren't very secure (I suggest implementing a fob key system), we don't always get daily updates on what activities the children did, there is a language barrier with some of the educators, and since October our kid has been coming home sick quite often which makes us worried that other parents are sending their kids to daycare sick. Despite these issues, we do recommend Star Learners due to the other great experiences we have had with them. They are also clean, affordable and send updates to parents often! Their app is nice and easy to use too.

Emailing seems to work best for them in case anyone is also experiencing difficulties getting a hold of them via phone.\n\n~previous post~\nFirst time mom trying to get my son into daycare and I can’t seem to get this daycare on phone. Am I the only one experiencing this? And they don’t return calls either. I have tried texting too but barely any response there as well.

All the educators are so loving and caring and it is evident in how much our children loved going to daycare every day and how they lit up every time they saw one of their favourite teachers (they are all favourite teachers). They take care of a child's immediate day-to-day needs, but also focus on growth, education, and happiness. Both our children thrived at STLDC, our oldest is ready for kindergarten because the educators focused on preparing him and teaching him the classroom and practical skills he needs to succeed.

They learned a lot from each teacher, and always had a great time at the daycare. They enjoyed the everyday outside time, when weather allowed. I also liked the fact that the food was cooked in the center, and my kids got used to eating a variety of foods. I knew my kids loved it there, when they did not want to go home at the end of the day. The staff was always approachable and easy to talk to. I wouldn't have kept them there for so long if my kids were not well taken care of.",

It has been an absolute joy for my daughter, and I couldn't be happier with her experience at this daycare.\n\nFirst and foremost, the director, teachers and caregivers at Summertime Daycare is exceptional. They are not only highly professional but also genuinely caring and nurturing towards the children. From the moment we enrolled our daughter, they made us feel welcome and ensured that all her needs were met. They go above and beyond to create a warm and supportive environment where the children can thrive.\n\nOne of the standout qualities of Summertime Daycare is the wide range of activities and programs they offer. Every day, my daughter is excited to go to daycare because she knows there will be something fun and engaging waiting for her. From arts and crafts to outdoor games, and educational projects, the daycare provides a well-rounded experience that keeps the children actively involved and entertained. The variety of activities helps foster creativity, physical development, and intellectual growth.\n\nMoreover, Summertime Daycare places a strong emphasis on social development and building a sense of community among the children. They encourage teamwork, cooperation, and respect, which has been instrumental in helping my daughter form strong friendships and develop important social skills.\n\nI must commend Summertime Daycare for their excellent communication and involvement with parents. They keep us well-informed about our child's daily activities, progress, and any important updates through newsletters, app, and face-to-face conversations during drop-off and pick-up times.",

        "text": "Summertime Daycare is an excellent place for a little one to start their journey of self discovery, friendships, and learning! I have always been very impressed with the staff (directors and teachers) as well as the impeccably clean environment. I highly recommend the daycare to all prospective parents.\n\nMy child started his tenure with Summertime at age 3 and has excelled over the almost two years since. As a child of the covid times he took some time to get acclimated to not being at home, but the team at Summertime were always very caring and patient with him to ensure his comfort without parents nearby. I feel very lucky to have the Summertime team as part of our \"village\" to help him grow. From the moment we stepped through the doors we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff, who displayed a genuine passion for working with children. The dedication and love they have for their job are evident in every interaction, creating a nurturing atmosphere that immediately put my mind at ease. I have witnessed the incredible bond my child has formed with their teachers, and it warms my heart to see the genuine love and support they receive.\n\nThe day to day activities are always changing and I really enjoy knowing that each week they focus on a new topic or idea to help expand their understanding of the world around. It's truly impressive to see how the daycare encourages each child's unique talents and interests.\n\nThe facilities at Summertime are fantastic, offering a bright and stimulating environment that fosters learning and exploration. The outdoor play area is a favorite of my child, where they get to engage in physical activities and build friendships with their peers. The classrooms are well-equipped with age-appropriate toys, books, and educational resources, providing ample opportunities for learning through play.\n\nI cannot speak highly enough of Summertime Daycare. They have created an environment that feels like a second home for my child, where they are nurtured, inspired, and encouraged to reach their full potential. I am immensely grateful for the love, care, and educational foundation that Summertime has provided to my little one. I wholeheartedly recommend this daycare to any parent looking for a place where their child can thrive, learn, and blossom.",

Unfortunately alot of the time my kids got sick.\n\nSunnyview was accommodating with catching up with paying if I fell behind. But in a year I had 1 incident i was going to be late by 10 minutes, owner insisted I needed to pay extra, and even called my wife who doesn't drive to pickup the kids.\n\nSunnview will not accept us back due to they cannot handle my children. Guess the owner has a change of heart.\n\nLastly I never seen pictures of my kids in any of there instagram photos. My kids will have great memories.

I'm now moving to the other side of the city so my son will not be able to go here. I called April 1st and explained to the manager and asked for my deposit back, she said sure and that she would have the owner contact me to set it up. A week and a half goes by, no call. So I contact the daycare again, and she then tells me it is actually non refundable and the money I gave was to register my son... what?? I asked multiple times for the owner to call me, the manager kept talking over me so I finally hung up. NO CALL from the owner. THEN, I wrote a review on facebook, which the owner replies that they need my number, they have it, or to call the daycare ( I have twice). She finally calls me the next day and practically calls me a liar, that there's no way her staff would misinform someone, even on an accident. If you cant see mistakes can be made on your end, I would hate to have my child in this daycare when something goes wrong. I'm so glad I found a wonderful daycare elsewhere. If you're stuck in the area, check out Skyview Daycare! They're not much further than this one, if I move back to the area I'll definitely put my son in there!",

The staff here is exceptional, providing a warm and loving atmosphere that makes you feel like family. The Montessori approach to learning has had a profound impact on my child's development - they've become more independent, curious, and confident.\n\nThe facility itself is immaculate, and safety is clearly a top priority. The diverse range of educational activities keeps the children engaged and excited about learning. Plus, the regular updates and communication with parents are greatly appreciated.\n\nI cannot express enough how thankful I am to have found Tawa Montessori Day Care. It's a place where my child did not only receive excellent care but also thrived academically and socially. I wholeheartedly recommend this daycare to any parent looking for the best possible start for their child.",

They absolutely enjoyed being there and loved all their teachers (I believe this is because the teachers loved them too and showed them genuine care and concern). The teachers were very patient with them, and took such great care of them. They were very accommodating of our needs, and changes when necessary. They provide a safe space for play and for learning, and encourage the children to study, to be respectful of one another and to be helpful. The girls already miss being there and we do hope to reconnect sometime. Our experience with Tawa Montessori has been nothing but an absolute pleasure.",

        "text": "This is a very special daycare. We’ve been with this daycare for over 13 years, with 3 kids that have gone through. The main thing I looked for from the beginning was cleanliness, following public health protocols, and of coarse a good fit for the kids. They have been very consistent over the years, it started out with a husband and wife that ran the daycare for over 20 years, then transitioned to the current owner Raman who has brought the daycare to a new level.\n\nThey take the time to help each child individually develop their skills and provide opportunities for concerts to see your kids shine, they also go into the community to perform for seniors at the nearby hospital and group homes.\n\nThey take the time to understand your family situations/needs and try their best to help out in the way they can. For example one of my kids would not sleep at home but would nap long at daycare, you ask them to shorten the nap and things fall into place at home…it’s appreciated. In many scenarios they have gone over and beyond to accommodate, with things that you would only expect a family member to do for you, not a business.\n\nIf you do have concerns, when you bring it to their attention they don’t delay in addressing it to completion.\n\nIt is a Montessori daycare and they use positive discipline for the kids. One of my kids after awhile it didn’t end up being a good fit because he was quite rambunctious and didn’t have the focus/interest in the Montessori pieces. Although, the staff went over and beyond to accommodate and tailor to his needs which was very touching. We ended up placing him in a more learning through play daycare that made a better fit. But my other 2 strived in this daycare as it fit their personalities and temperament much better.\n\nAll the staff are very friendly with big hearts for the kids. I like that the owner continues to support their professional development. At times you’ll see them having staff nights after hours.\n\nOverall this daycare is extraordinary! Thank you Tawa Montessori!",

This school gave me the supportive community I really needed when I entered the world of motherhood. There was so many supportive teachers and staff who helped me throughout my time there. A few times After late nights with the baby, I fell asleep on the library couch and I felt safe enough to do that there. There was a daycare on site where my son went, which made drop offs and pick ups less stressful. I made friends here and we would have sleep overs with our kids, go out to lunch with them and travel the mall together. It made being a teen mom more enjoyable and because my friends were in the same stage of life I rarely felt left out. It made a major impact in my life as a young mom, one I won’t ever forget.

An do nothing wrong but if young moms have issues adapting to life exorcism at 14 and 15 they add more areas in them with this finding. Great idea to help students but they also give student a reason to drop out and not complete school.  If students have been in the hospital or better take care of their sick children and adults we get to take the time off  work and do so without taking her children to the doctors or anything like that but now when they’re in the school the teaching them that you need to run to the doctors for every little thing that is wrong with your child from a mother of five that’s not the case I do not run to the doctors every time my child is sick but I do keep them away from other kids so they cannot get it was well as well as if you have a child was struggling with a learning disability and they need that one on one time in the computer room or whatever the case may be with a talking to counselors there they’re always marked absent which goes against the funding so then they get kicked off so once again leaving stress on a young mom for dangerous things to happen luckily my daughter has a great support team but some teen moms aren’t that lucky .

They teach compassion, empathy skills, and work to offer well-informed education! Love that they were willing to accomodate our plant based and vegan needs, and their staff were always honest and worked with me to help me stay consistent in parenting!

Although I was there for another reason, but looking at the owners direct involvement in the business, I was impressed! They showed me around! The place was very neat and clean. I really liked how the different rooms were laid-out for the different age group children. I sincerely wish them a great success!",

The Mastermind experience will certainly keep me coming back. The only issue I had with them was that they kept asking me to show them the payment receipt over and over again when they hadn't saved it, which was annoying.  All daycare staff are very friendly and accommodating.  When my kids were leaving, one of my daughters' staff members had tears in her eyes because she missed my little girl. My older daughter was very shy at first, but they were able to bring her out of her shell and get her comfortable talking with other children. This is a place I recommend to my friends and others.",

It was suggested I get him assessed, I took him to his Doctor. A letter was written to the daycare that he was a normal little boy who did not need assessment. That was not acceptable at this daycare, I am being accused of not putting any effort into this assessment, that apparently  the manager of this daycare, (who by the way knows better than my sons pediatrician) that is not even necessary.  For the past few months this is all I heard about, assessment assessment! Try this on for size Amy, hire more incompetent workers that call me out of school because my son is having a bad day!  Who does that? What this daycare needs is structure and a lot  more experience interacting with children. I was told the staff being hired at this daycare all had teaching credentials, I am pretty sure if you were to ask any one of them to provide such paperwork, you would get the run around or absolutely nothing. The one and only daycare worker at this establishment that sees children for what they are (just children growing up) is Catherine. My son has been bitten on several occasions, he has been scratched on the face, punched in the face but not once did I hear about any of those incidents. They have a book full of incidents about my child (again being a 3 1/2 year old little boy) causing problems and hurting other kids. He was in this daycare for most of his life, spending 9 hours a day with the staff and picked up a few habits that he  should have been given a time out for, oh yeah right, Sunshine Factory has no disciplinary actions for bad behavior...NONE! So now that my child has learned some bad habits at daycare hes no longer welcome at this very daycare.",

I was so nervous about her sleep because at home she was always nursed to sleep and rocked. I made the care providers aware of this when she first started and asked how they could/would support her during sleep, and they reassured me that they would start off by holding her and slowly transition to her sleeping on the cot like the other babies (she now sleeps on the cot like the others, and naps much better at home as well). They also do so many cute, fun, and learning activities, I can't believe how much my daughter has learnt since starting in September. The ladies who work at the centre are all so friendly, we are always greeted at the door with a smile. My daughter is so excited to go and see her friends and teachers. I cannot say enough good things about this place! Highly recommend!! Thank you Tiny Hoppers for taking such great care of our daughter!",

As first-time parents, we were both somewhat anxious about leaving our child somewhere new, but the daycare laid all of that anxiety to ease as soon as we walked in the door.\n\nThe daycare itself is a clean, fun, and cheerful facility that is filled with experienced, friendly, and truly caring staff. The daycare has nice sized groups based on age which is perfect for keeping the kids engaged with others developing just like them. For us parents, the daycare is very conveniently located to our downtown workplace for easy drop off and pickup.\n\nMost importantly, our daughter absolutely loves it here. There are rotating supervised crafts and activities for all the kids every day, both indoor and outdoor when the weather is nice, which has our daughter constantly smiling. Not only are the activities great but the activities promote key learning skills and are great for learning to be around and play with other kids, too.\n\nWe think Tiny Hoppers has been amazing and definitely recommend to any parent looking for a quality center for their kiddo or kiddos!",

The staff are always accommodating and friendly. The center has a calming atmosphere that is clean, welcoming and organized.

It's really great to see that you're responsive, especially since I noticed that you haven't replied to other negative reviews. I was hoping that you would extend an invitation to those individuals to come and discuss their concerns with your team.\n\nI really appreciate that you didn't take offense to my honest assessment of your daycare. It's clear to me that there are some serious issues with how it's being run. It's not surprising that you haven't responded to other people's negative experiences either.\n\nDuring the short time I worked for you, I got to know all of the employees, but I won't mention their names because I'm concerned that they could be mistreated or threatened due to the poor management. It's my hope that you'll address these issues of unprofessionalism and the inadequate scheduling, as nobody wants a 90-minute break during an 8-hour shift.\n\nThank you again, and I hope you'll take these suggestions into consideration.",

As far as the play area in the back they have a bunch of toys in great condition. All 4 of my children have special needs. The director and staff make sure my kids follow the the rules which I appreciate. They don't make exceptions nor single out 1 child for another.

Everything is equipped with quality Montessori materials.  There is also a lot of space inside and outside for walking and playground  space for children of all ages. It can be seen that the owner of this center cares about the education of children and the cleanliness of the center.  Winter and summer always clean and comfortable.  Every day we know what new our son has learned and we have every month education plan. This center is more suitable for a family who wants to see their children in a large team, like a school.  I recommend this center as a big family of which your family will become a part.",

He learned so much and always had lots of stories to tell me. He participated in so many fun activities and field trips. Every morning and evening we were ALWAYS greeted with smiles from the teachers, it is such a warm and loving atmosphere. The facility is very clean and bright and the food is healthy. All the staff here are beyond amazing and approachable and loving to the children. The ONLY reason my son is no longer attending is because we recently moved to another city. It was heartbreaking for myself and son leaving and the staff were also sad too. We miss them so very much and I would 100% recommend them to anyone. We miss all of you!!",

After asking in details, they admitted he didn't eat. We started packing food he loves, but these food came back untouched . they probably never offered it to him. .\nReasons for kicking him out according to them,\n\n- He is knocking things over, my 3 year old son doesn't do that\n-My wife is uncooperative because she asked to drop of bottled water for him( due to worries of lead content )\n-My wife didn't explain his autistic tendencies - this was a lie, this was one of the first info she gave.\n-My kid bites other kids ( again a big lie, they retracted when i insisted on evidences)\n-Other Kids want my kid gone ( a sweet group of 2 yrs and 3yrs old, asking my kid to leave? highly unlikely ) .\n\nMy kid was obviously traumatized and he couldn't tell us anything, we gave him days of tender loving care and I promised i will never take him to that place again.

The instructors are all outstanding, professional and approachable. The learning taught was outstanding with their own Willowbrae SEEDS program which you can see what they learned and will be learning. As a teacher, I appreciated seeing this. When looking at other daycares, it felt like they let the kids do whatever.  The academy sells its self when you go for a tour, you get a sense this feels like a school.\nIn June, they put on the best graduation ceremony outside when my son was ready to attend Grade K next year!

Then, look up competitors and see how few violations they have by contrast.\n\nWhy can those other daycares meet basic regulatory requirements, but this one can’t?\n\nIf this were your business, wouldn’t you spend the little extra time and money obviously needed to get it running properly?\n\nI won’t go into details about my son’s injury.

        "text": "Things I've noticed... Which show concerns for leadership within the organization .. staff are parking directly in front of daycare causing parents to cross drivelane with children.  Turnover of facilities director and assistant director appears to have trickled down to front line, curious if this is poor pay or culture ? The new director is always in her office at beginning of day and end of day, but had yet to be observed walking the hallway and greeting the kids or parents...  I'm not sure their background, but it is a noticeable and drastic shift from the leadership which originally attracted the customers and employees to the facility... I unfortunately expect more changes as this location struggles to find it's true leader...  in addition When staff aren't consistently getting down on the kids level to speak with them it's like they've never met a kid or learned how to successfully communicate with them..  frustrating, because the facility is nice... But if you start looking at staff  behaviour and culture there's growing pains to say the least ....\n\nUpdate.. unfortunate to see that even after pointing out the obvious staff parking directly in front of the location, the Mazda CX5, Toyota Camry, and several white and silver Honda civics are still prominently parked directly in front,  even adjacent to the stroller ramp.. 22 years ago a FutureShop manager taught me that customers should never have to walk past an employee's car, it's a sign of respect... Or lack there of... For the people that allow them to be employed ..",

        "text": "I want to commend the teachers and staff at Windermere Daycare because they did great work with my two boys who had no background in group settings whatsoever and have an extremely difficult time being away from mom and dad.\n\nMy sons' teachers were attentive, patient, and supportive. When they realized that my youngest responded really well to music, they'd sing to him every morning when he entered the room to help ease his anxiety and crying. That little act meant a lot to me at drop-off.\n\nThe directors are professional, very approachable, and easy to communicate with. They always have an open door, and they were accommodating too.\n\nThis was my first experience with daycare for my kids and while on the search, I'm glad I overlooked the \"bells and whistles\" that some of the other daycares have that doesn't necessarily add any value to the level of care my children would receive. Knowing that my kids were being well cared for (and more) was all the assurance I needed.\n\nLastly, I love the diversity of staff members that work here and the diversity of children and families this daycare serves. I would definitely recommend!",

When I first started, I was full-time in one of the daycare rooms. I then decided to go back to school and they worked around my whole university schedule. For the last 5 years I worked in the OSC, during the summer they plan an amazing program for the kids which includes field trips once a week and different activities throughout the week.\n\nI had an amazing experience with them, and I highly recommend this center. The staff cares about the children and makes an effort to get to know them and the parents. I truly enjoyed my time working here. I will truly miss each and everyone of them.",

The staff greeted me and my child by name every morning and always wished me a good day as I was leaving.\nAnytime we've had an issue or concern/question, I have emailed the daycare directly and Punnu has been very responsive to my concerns, investigates the matter fully and always openly communicated with me about steps she took to address any concerns or questions I had.

So far my baby has been in the infant room and the junior toddler (or however it's called) and she is comfortable with the ladies taking care of her in both rooms. She got used to the daycare pretty quickly with not many issues which makes me comfortable thinking that she feels well taken care there. I had high anxiety leaving my baby to be taken care by others considering that I practice attachment parenting and my baby has never slept without me nearby, but she naps at daycare better than she does at home! Overall the place is always clean, and they send photos of the daily play experience and updates on how much baby is eating, napping and how many diaper changes are performed. They also offer morning and afternoon snacks.",

Affordable price, which is $25/day with the support of federal government, unfortunately it will be end till April.\n2. Varieties of programs for kids to play and learn, in daycare and home kits as well. This is something we enjoy the most.\n3. Weemarkable App provide pictures indoor and outdoor, weekly snack menu, messages between parents and caregivers.\n4. Friendly staff, my son likes one Filipino lady Editha, she helped my son during potty training, offered some helpful information.\n5. Start from April they will offer lunch\n6. If the daycare shutdown due to Covid, they will offer credit return for the following month.\n\nCons: 1. Before you decided to join this daycare, be ready to pay full month, even you join the daycare in the middle of the month.\n2.During Covid time, they shut down the main entrance to stop parents go inside picking up kids. Just imagine when the weather is minus 30 degrees, and parents waiting outside freezing like idiots and hoping the staffs could see us and come out to open the door faster",

The staff are amazing, they are always there for the kids and never ever leave them alone in the room. They work hard to include every child in activities, take them outside to play, rain or shine, and have a social support program if you need to talk to someone. They observe every child and provide you with recommendations on how to deal with issues that arise. For example, my child was speech delayed and they provided me with materials on how to help him speak more and now he doesn't stop talking lol. He also wasn't engaging with other children and the staff incorporated his interests in the activities to catch his attention. Staff works with you figure out your child's interests so he can engage in activities. We were so lucky to get a spot here. You will never regret sending your child here.",

In fact, the whole center and staff are warm and welcoming. They follow great routines and help settle the kids into a routine that can be integrated into home life. Their Weemarkable reports are so much more detailed than any other daycare centers I have seen and take various photos of the daily activities my kid participated in. It very much helped us aware of what our kid was up to while we were busy at work, so we could still set up some routine at home for the weekends and continuously help her learn through play. The fact that we can choose to get the lunch catered is also amazing since it takes the stress away for working mom and dad while our kid tries a variety of foods.",

I wanted to wait a while to write a review to get the full scope of the operation.\n\nThe first month I had placed my son for the mornings only to help him adjust. I sat in with my son one day to see how all the kiddos interacted and what their day looked like. After a month he was doing so well that I left him there for nap time and picked him up right after. After a couple weeks of doing that I left him there longer. It took a while but the daycare and it’s staff allowed me to slowly integrate my son and were understanding and accommodating to both the needs of my son and I. When I pick up my son now he is happy and smiling.\n\nI also love this daycare because they have designated snack and lunch times but would always offer snacks when a child would appear to be hungry or if the child asks for one. Food and water is never restricted! I can bring all my sons favourite foods so that he actually eats. Sometimes some food comes home and sometimes all the food is gone! It’s all based on when and how much the child wants to eat. Not based on other daycares “menus” where the child may not like certain foods.\n\nAs for diaper changes, they check and change frequently. My son always leaves with a clean diaper on and has never developed a rash.\n\nThe environment of the daycare is also welcoming and accommodating. I also love the fact that it’s situated in an elementary school and not off a busy road where it’s loud or close to undesirable places. They have an enclosed  playground just for the little ones outside. The daycare also plans various activities, picnics, walks, playground visits, outdoor games ect.\n\nMy son comes home happy and I’m satisfied that he gets a day filled with lots of fun play, storytelling, arts and crafts ect. Also his speech is greatly improving from being around the other kids! All I can say is that the ladies I have interacted with and who take care of my son are all amazing. Their job can be difficult dealing with little human beings all day long but you can tell they love and care for children. I’m happy that my son attends this daycare and recommend it to anyone. Thank you!",

        "text": "My daughter has been at Youngstown daycare a month and a half now, by the third week I wanted to write a review but thought, let me wait so this isn’t written too soon. I am so happy I enrolled my daughter here! At the previous daycare my daughter was in, she was in a 2-3 year old room so I was anxious for her to be with children a couple years older at Youngstown but honestly, she’s thriving and it’s what she needed! My daughter has a speech delay so being around children that talk and interact has been beneficial. All the ladies working here are amazing, kind and have such great attitudes. They want your children to be happy, healthy and do well. The thing I’m most impressed with is that they make sure the children are fed and not hungry. An issue with the previous daycare was that my daughter was always hungry at pickup. breakfast/lunch/snacks was being provided by the facility but I would bring extra and it wouldn’t be given to my daughter. it would be very hard taking her home because she’d be throwing tantrums and starving. But here, her whole attitude is changed, I trust that she’s being fed the food I provide and she’s never in a bad mood when I come to pick up. She cried when I left in the morning for the first week, than by the second week she was walking into the daycare room by herself, going straight to her chair or to the educator for breakfast forgetting about me lol! There’s a lot of stuff they do with the children: reading, arts and crafts, games or just letting them do their own thing and play. There’s lots of variety of toys as well. They do potty training which is great! My daughter is attached to her baby doll and they’ve been working with her to break that attachment so she’s not dependent on the doll and need to bring it everywhere. I’m just so amazed. The owner is so nice and is there frequently to not just oversee the daycare but to step in and help out in whatever rooms need extra hands. I would definitely recommend this daycare!",

We have been with this agency for 3 years and have loved every minute. His educator is dedicated, compassionate, caring and vigilant. She goes above and beyond and knows my son better than most family. We consider her part of our family. When he started there after Covid- he was on the 13th percentile for speech. We of course (like most) were on a wait list- fast forward 5 months- when his name came up for assistance they re-assessed and he was at the 87th percentile!!! Now some of that was maturity and some of it was being around people again but with 1000% certainty I can say that it was also because of the hard work of his educator. She worked hard and diligently with him on sounds and letters and now he is rocking and rolling ready for kindergarten! She was also our potty training angel! Asked us our method and how she could help!!! We have had nothing but amazing experiences with her.\nNow to the office staff-  if it weren’t for Karen helping us get subsidy and helping us navigate the government incentives we would still be paying full price! She had nothing to gain by doing so! They have been beyond flexible and the communication between agency and parents is bar none! If your looking for somewhere that will take your kids and nurture and love them as if they were their own! This is the place!!!",

Thank you for the great service you have constantly provided our family Kawal and also thank you to NEFDHA for helping our family with a suitable day home !",

Michelle was incredibly helpful in guiding me through the enrollment process, making the transition into a new environment seamless. The quality of child care offered by the day home is top-notch and my kids are always happy when I pick them up at the end of the day. I highly recommend Northalta Family Day Care Service Ltd to anyone in need of quality child care services.",

        "text": "THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST DAYHOME AGENCY COMPANY!!!! My daughter was with Saima Maryam, and when my daughter started I asked her about updating the daily pictures, and activities where that is sent to the parents? And this lady had the audacity to tell me that, “with this agency we don’t do that since the parents will get upset if the see she sent me my daughters picture with the other kids”. Then I said to her to be clear as it states in the contract it says “if parents had to post it on social media or even the dayhome caregiver then they need the consent of the parents. As she starting getting aware that I read everything and I know what I’m talking about. And I pulled the contract out and even showed it to her. Then she knew she was caught as she responded saying “oh yeah we do but no parents ask for that”. Then from there she didn’t want to provide food to my daughter as she told me “my daughter was the only kid who was older as the rest of the 2 kids were only drinking milk”. Then on a day I was dropping off my daughter told me Saima Maryam scared her, and she admitted it when I brought it up to her attention but made it look like it wasn’t a big deal. After that incident about 2weeks after my daughter shares with me that Saima Maryam hit her on her hand. As soon as she told me this I never sent her back and immediately stopped her from going to her dayhome!!!! The AGENCY’S they DON’T CARE AT ALL!!! THEY ARE ALL TRASH and BAD MINDED PEOPLE!!!! I gave it 1 start bc it wouldn’t let me post this review unless I give it a start!!! THEY DESERVE NONE!!!!",

She showed me a huge binder of credentials she had obtained in this exact type of children and never felt challenged by my description. She said she knew how to manage. In effect, she knew! Tayyba was great every day we went to her. My son started speaking in no time, he was showing progress in every field, he became more organized and learned how to control his impulses. Tayyba also provided very good and nutritious home made food. Her place is always clean and organized and she has endless activities to support children development. My son is now at school full time and not going to Tayyba's Dayhome anymore, but we are still friends and he visits her time to time and have a great relationship with Tayyba's son and daughter. She is the most amazing Dayhome we have ever had experience with. 💕",

Still they charge extra. Don't know they have accountant at all or they are doing this on purpose. Please stay away from them as they don't care about your money.

I was in the process of filling out paperwork that was sent to me from the agency. I was in constant communication with the rep as I had questions along the way. Over the weekend while awaiting the response from my last email I filled out the paperwork ready to send them in first thing Monday morning, but instead I received an email saying that there were no longer any spots for me at the dayhome. I quickly responded looking for an explanation why, with a copied message from the dayhome operator previously congratulating me for getting two spots. I did not hear back and I still haven't a week later. This agency is very unprofessional and I would not recommend them to anyone.",

        "text": "My 2.5 yr old daughter and I absolutely love her educator from this agency, not to mention the care and professionalism that the consultant affiliated with the educator shows, as well.\nNot only that the educator is a genuinely kind person who takes a wonderful care of your child, she provides creative activities and programs that my daughter enjoys daily. My daughter constantly surprises me with new songs, skills, and dances that she's learned from her teacher. The teacher sometimes lets my daughter bring some books so she can continue enjoy reading them at home. She also makes the best snacks and meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Lastly, I really appreciate that she provides thorough feedbacks on my child daily when my husband or I pick her up or by sending us pictures of what our child did during the day.\nThe consultant visits the day home once a month to check up on the facility and program of the day home and also provides feedbacks to the parents. When the educator goes on a vacation, they find a back-up care close to your place so there is a minimal disruption.\nThere really is nothing I can complain about the educator or the agency. I'd recommend this agency to anyone I care about. Keep in mind though, that if you want to register your child, do it in advance. My daughter was in the waitlist for about 1.5 yrs?2 years?, then finally found a space only after one kid grew old enough to go to kindergarten.\n\nThanks, Southgate Medallion Family Day Homes!",
