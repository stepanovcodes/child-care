He comes home excited to tell me about all of the new things he has learned. We have not found a daycare that is quite like this one. Apart from that the level of cleanliness is amazing. I am grateful for the staff at this daycare, its a great feeling to be able to leave my kid with them while I work and not worry about him there.",

My Son has been going there since he was 1 years old and now 20 Months and I was so nervous in the beginning when you have to go back to work, but each person has made me feel like they treat my Son like their own. I can text call anytime to find out how he’s doing! What a warm, welcoming and caring Daycare. Could not be happier.\nHe will be there for many more years to come! Thank you Sammi for running a wonderful atmosphere. And Anoop is amazing!!!",

He has issues with eating and choking quite often and everyone who takes care of him is aware of his situation and thank God to this day we have never had an issue with him choking at daycare because he needs to be supervised while he eats and clearly is watched carefully and attentively.\n\nWe live in Auburn Bay and have day homes within walking distance and other daycare but the drive is completely worth it because I know when I leave him there he is being well cared for and I can go to work without worries at all. He is learning so much with all the teachers and his vocabulary is getting better and better.\n\nThe cleanliness and precautions they have taken with COVID still give me peace of mind when I drop him off and as we all adjust and learning how to improve and be more cautious so are they and im incredibly grateful.\n\nI would recommend them to anyone and everyone!",

I love the buildings and the space they've come up with. The teachers are so caring and great with the kids. The buildings are kept extra clean and are very bright and welcoming. It will be a sad day for us, when we no longer require Child Care, as Active Start has been a major part of our family.",

        "text": "3 of my kids went Al Amal, frankly my kids loved their teacher and enjoyed their preschool time. I read other people's review and I totally disagree with their oponion, and experiences but i highly respect them. I tried to breakdown most negative reviews I hope this might help future parents questions. One of the review says that teachers do not greeting their students? Well they do everyday! Secondly preschool has no outside area, so it is not safe for letting kids out alone as teachers cannot patrolize each kids thus they need to be indoor. They have sometimes breaks, not all the time, but I do not mind if their teacher do not give break because we got lot of Stat holidays, kids get sick missing their schools or for parent's reason we skip kid's school day etc. I hope you get my point here, so they need to follow up their cirriculum. But also its all about kids learning process which most family have no time out of school time. Another thing is that why should we so worry about snack if they give little vegi? All I consider is what my kids learning in his school. Is not that the best vitamin is education? So let them enjoy their moment. Frankly, if your kids has no happiness in this school go dive into it, learn the reason, but sometimes kids are too shy and/or not too social. These are characteric of being human, we cannot expect their teachers to break that ice. The school has some events or cookie days, helping other people in Ramadan these are great opportunities for kids to involve. It just time processing of growing we cannot expect change everything in miracle. I fell that after taking my 3 kids to Al Amal in different years, I should show my thankness to all teachers this way and help parents to make their decision in their way. Thank you Al Amal. Assalamun alaykum.",

I have the following suggestions for the staff:\n\n1- Assign a happy smiling person to greet kids and parents when they arrive. Miss Hiba used to be better than other staff in greeting. Kids need to be welcomed and get the energy when they arrive. This is very important, Miss Renata.\n2- They need to be more careful if a kid does something wrong. The staff needs to be trained on how to react against kids behavior.\n3- There were a couple of times our kid was injured in the school. Although it was OK and it may happen, but we were never told what happened! Our kid explained to us and it seems the staff were aware of the injury and they even used band aid for our kid. The staff must inform families if something happens even if it is not serious.",

My child was not happy there and was unable to see the light of day throughout his time there.\n\nThey never allowed the children outside breaks and was a very regimented schedule....more like a military school than a preschool. When I enquired as to why they are not allowed outside playtime the answer I received from the owner/operater was \"the kids aren't here for fun, they are here to study\". Last I checked, that's what Universities are for.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this preschool for parents that just want a loving, caring, child friendly environment....it is more for parents that want to put their kids through boot camp.\n\nAs well, the cancellation policy is just a mish mash of fine print that allows the owner to capitalize on keeping extra money and recieving extra funding through government subsidies.\n\nThis is basically an Islamic Preschool with Un-Islamic policies and procedures.",

This meant an inconvenient trip to a bank every month coupled with frequent follow ups by the lady, who received my child in the morning, on whether we had paid. That only stopped after told I her to make more effort to coordinate communication with the administrator. We were later provided with the option for transfer upon insistence.\n\nThe experience with the director (Jacklyn) in addressing why my child was returning home with torn clothe was appalling. After several follow ups in trying to find out why the cause of the rips, I once got a beyond inane suggestion of coming to visit the facility to see myself. I was quick to point out that visiting the facility and not finding anything  does not change the fact that the something within the facility was responsible for causing the damage. Beyond the rip to clothing was the bigger concern of the possibility that my child was being exposed to something so unsafe to cause the rip. Meeting with Jacklyn in person to address it was the peak as she showed an absolute lack of concern, which bordered on being racist. As you can imagine, that was our last day there.\n\nIf you cannot make your environment safe or take responsibility for what happens within your facility, you have no business being in childcare.",

The teachers at Alpine, specifically my daughters teachers are so warm and welcoming each day. Although I’ve been told the building was an older church, the rooms are well equipped  the outdoor yards are new with that synthetic turf and regular walks to the neighbourhood park are a bonus. I’ve registered my oldest for kindergarten with Ms Nikki (as the other parents raved about how much their kids learned this year) she loves her class and teachers Ms Krystal & Ms Emma ,  begging me to hurry to get to school each morning. I am glad to keep her one more year in a smaller environment without big city bussing to/from school) My toddler has now turned 3 which means she just joined the Jr Montessori class with Ms Sara. Looking forward to no more diapers as they have helped potty train. I think most of teachers have been here a while and seem happy. I’ve also met one of the family owners a few times now - nice to know she frequents regularily... Thank you ladies at Alpine!",

They juggle the varying needs of the children in their care seamlessly while also meeting the requests and preferences us parents have. They worked with us to ensure the needs of our children are continually met and effectively communicate their processes when helping teach the children new skills – whether it be potty training, nap training, making new friends or learning a new skill.\n\nBoth my daughter and son love going to daycare each morning. The consistent, clear communication used to speak to and teach our children is truly beyond our expectations; we have the utmost confidence our kids are in the best care available.\n\nThe safe, caring environment has allowed our daughter and son to make amazing friendships with the providers and children within the Art and Soul Montessori program. We are constantly grateful for the top-notch care they receive each day.\n\nWe have had a wonderful experience and would not hesitate to recommend Art and Soul Montessori for any childcare needs.",

There is a notable difference in the personality of kids who attend Aspen Hill Montessori when it comes to discipline, independence and social interactions. In terms of school administration, school has strict policies but  I feel it is necessary to run the school effectively. My experience with the administration team has always been pleasant and easy.

Luches fed daily contradicted the calender posted.  In my opinion, there appears to be no structure at all and I'm very sure our child learned nothing while there.  In my expierence, the owner is unreasonable, overly defensive and not solution oriented.  Care giver turnover is very large.

My child goes to RM Royal Daycare already 6 month and there is something what I really want to tell.\nWe came from Ukraine and my child didn’t speak English at all. First weeks it was really hard for him and for as a parents. But with staff, with teachers from RM Royal daycare this time became a beautiful.\nMy son looks forward to going there every day. Sometimes he doesn’t want to go home when we pick him up:))\nDuring the day I receive photos of my son and how is his day going, what kind of food is he eating, what kind of activities does he has.\nTeachers there are extremely nice, friendly. They always understand what child wants and they know each child very good.\n\nEvery time teachers telling me stories about my son, what he likes to do the most, his behavior in different situations. He already speaks English good with such a great support from teachers and he has learned so much since going here!\nChildren are growing up in such a great place with a lot of activities!\n\nTeachers have an individual approach to each child. Our son is in the safe place and I know when we drop our son off every morning - he will be well taken care of.\n\nI’m glad I found them!",

This is his last year there and reflecting back I have to say that the caregivers have done an excellent job in helping raise my son.\n\nI  credit the team with potty training him, trying new foods, teaching him respect and manners just to name a few.  Over the years there has been plenty of impressive activities such as yoga, dance, singing, Christmas concerts, show & tell and even the odd field trip in the neighborhood.\nThe facility is professionally set up and well maintained as a daycare and has dedicated areas geared towards the specific groups to aid in their development at their specific age range.\n\nThe caregivers/teachers are all professional accredited and certified and genuinely care bout the children.  My son has learned to read and write all of the alphabet as well as numbers to 20 and they have now even started simple math additions.\n\nThe location is extremely handy being just of of Bow Trail and the hours are exceptional compared to other places.\n\nThank you Bow Trail Daycare!",

My child learned so much from the staff at this daycare and they made sure that the transition to Kindergarten will be easy for my child.\n\nThey have so many resources if you need help. If they think your child is in need of help with speech or mortar skills, they will get someone to come and help your child so school will be easier for them.\n\nFurthermore, Brentwood childcare is clean, safe and fun! Thanks Brentwood Childcare Center for caring and loving my child!",

        "text": "A million stars!!  My son attends Acadia Brightpath and he has learnt so much already and he's been there just about 6 months.  Understandably sending your child into childcare however that looks for you can be difficult but the care and attention from the staff for my son has been absolutely fantastic. They made the transition so easy for my husband, our son and I which helped with the fears and anxieties surrounding a change like this.  I would forever recommend Acadia Brightpath for anyone sending their child into care, the staff care for your kids like they're their own and it really shows, our son loves being there.  They don't just watch your kids either they play with them, help them learn, teach new things (our son now knows the sign for more which is so adorable 🥰), get down and actually spend time with them especially if they're new to the room.\nIt's all just so comforting to have people who care like this looking after our precious children❤️\n1000/10 would always recommend!!!",

Everyone at Creekside - literally from the Director, to the floor managers, to their teachers, to their absolutely remarkable admin staff - is warm, welcoming, receptive to open communication about any concern you may have, and genuinely excited to spend the day with your kid.

The development of skills in our son have been enhanced and his ability towards speaking, listening, eye contact, behaviors, friendliness - I mean everything has been developed with the activities & learning patterns they have been developing for kids on daily basis.\n\nHe recently graduate as a Toddler to the new class Room # 2 as his transition was very smooth to the new environment. They gradually introduced him to the new class once a week then twice and then fulltime slowly. Again the support of all the teachers in this room-2 was amazing during this transition period. I would say they have one of the best Educated &  Experienced staff members. They recently celebrated his Birthday at the day care and due to Health concerns they baked an Inhouse cake for his celebration - which just surprised us, we are very thank full for thinking about the safety of all kids and teachers, i would say BIG kudos to the Directors & Teachers of the facility.\n\nLong story short this is an amazing day care facility in this area and this is truly meant for the bright future path of our kids. The staff at this facility has been working Tirelessly in these tough times and have been immensely supportive. BIG THANK YOU !",

They have a great curriculum and I receive updates monthly on what the primary focus of their learning will be that month. I also receive daily updates and photos on what my son is learning for the day, what he eats, when and how long he naps, ect. The educators are so caring and attentive to the children.  My son has food allergies that the educators take very seriously and they ensure that all new staff are notified. My son comes home learning something new everyday and has made friends as well! we love BrightPath and are very happy with our choice in childcare. Our number one priority is that our son is learning in a safe, happy and interactive environment where he is cared for and brightpath has checked off all the boxes. Thank you!",

They made this transition such an amazing and positive experience for our family. It was clear how comfortable and safe our son felt with them immediately; he absolutely adored them and it was clear they felt the same. The relief we felt as parents, because of this, was immeasurable.\n\nHe just recently moved on to the toddler room and although we are very sad to be leaving Anita and Ranjiv, we know that he is ready for that transition, and he will form new bonds with the wonderful educators in that room.\n\nIn addition to the educators, both Shabnam and Amarjot (center directors) are always so helpful, communicative and responsive.\nWe would 100% recommend this facility to anyone looking for a daycare for their children.\n\nBryn Jones",

My son's teachers were well-informed about his developmental phases and milestones. They were there for him when he faced difficulties. As a starting English speaker, Ms. Shabnam assisted my kid in his mother tongue language and I could go to her for advice if I needed it. Children are always given age-appropriate and open-ended learning opportunities by their caregivers. My son gained a variety of skills, including the development of his social and emotional skills, as well as the ability to build relationships with children, share and take turns, listen, and communicate his emotions. My kid and the other children are cared for by the educators in a loving and compassionate way. They feel happy, safe and excited to learn and explore their interests.

When a spot opened up to us for our 1 year old, I knew I had to jump on it, even though we were already enrolled elsewhere to start. From the beginning they have been informative, helpful, kind and supportive offering any help to ease our transition for our son and family. I trust this daycare, even being here a short time, we love his teachers - and have witnessed their loving and gentle attitudes towards our son, and the community of families have been so warm and welcoming to us. We are truly grateful to have the privilege in enrolling here and hope to bring all our future kids here as well! This daycare knows their stuff, know how to provide great activities, meal menus and they pay close attention to every child’s individual needs. Hands down, the best there is! Thank you again and again.",

        "text": "My son and daughter both currently attend BrightPath McKenzie and I truly cannot say enough positive things.  I was initially nervous about sending them to a daycare vs. a dayhome, thinking they would not receive any love and affection; however, this is so far from the truth.  They receive so much love and affection and are cared for by EVERYONE at the daycare, not just their teachers.  As you walk through the hallways all staff is so friendly and say hi.  My children know basically all of the staffs' names and this was something that really stood out to me in a positive light.  The meals they are fed are fabulous and I have found it has really helped open their horizon - things you would assume they would never eat at home, they are eating happily here!  And of course, they learn so much!  They follow a fantastic, age appropriate, curriculum and I have noticed such growth in both my children.  I could go on and on with all the positive things I have to say :)",

There is opportunity for outdoor time in both summer and winter with age appropriate areas/activities. There is also an indoor gym/area when the weather does not cooperate.\n\nThe staff in the rooms is attentive and engaging with the children. This is in contrast to our experience with a different daycare where the staff paid more attention to their mobile devices.\n\nThere are special planned activities throughout the month (fun hair day, stuffie day, sprinkler day, etc.) that go over and above the normal learning program provided.\n\nAs with most care facilities in Calgary, there was a considerable waitlist. I'm not sure if that is still the case now. Even so, we are happy that with the switch from a different provider.",

When my oldest had BIG emotions and challenging behaviours I witnessed he and other children being met with hugs and compassion; being allowed to talk with their teachers till they feel better. I always get feedback and they are so transparent about what is happening- updates on the new things my kids are doing are so incredibly appreciated because without the anecdotes, pictures and stories it’s hard to know you’re missing them. I love when I get a funny story at pick up, ant other centres I never had any clue about their day. I can tell they all really enjoy what they do. It comes through in their way with the kids and the activities they plan.",

The curriculum and nutrition is currated with littles in mind and is always changing and keeping the kids engaged. Choosing a daycare is hard, but I feel comfortable everyday with the care provided to my child and that I've made the right choice. Thanks to all that make BrightPath Rundle such a fantastic place.",

They had Chase from Paw Patrol, Moana and Belle come and do a meet and greet with them during the ceremony, goodie bags, and then lunch afterwards for everyone to attend.

Our daughter began daycare here at just under 1 year and stayed til she turned 3, I can honestly say I would not have wanted anything different for her. The staff are all wonderful, caring and gentle people. The care is excellent. The facility is a little aging but very quaint, secure, safe and homey. I highly recommend taking a tour if you are looking for a childcare option.",

My child attended no more than 3 days at one of their day homes and my child broke out in what appears to be hives or some virus. A day after picking up my child I noticed that he was incoherent and was not able to respond to me like he usually does. I paid full fee and when I asked for my money back hours before they close they told me I have to wait until after the holiday. These people don’t care about your child. They could care less. They will put you on the back burner especially if you choose to discontinue your agreement with them. They never asked me if my child was okay or if they could help. Most parents have no idea what these people are feeding their child. It’s a sad system and sad reality. And a lot is going on that parents don’t know. When I told the care giver to not give my child meat and rice and foods we don’t eat at home they still did it anyway, which lead to sickness and now added problems. They do not care about your requests which are different for different children.\n\nI am appalled by the treatment and disregard for a little child who is now suffering. I have no choice but to go to the hospital to figure out if my child is okay.\n\nJust be aware of whom you choose to leave your child with.\n\nUpdate: I received only a portion of money back for the days not used. Thanks for returning money. If you choose to use a dayhome from this agency be sure to do lots of research beforehand. Good luck.",

Lastly, I felt humiliated at the school in a way, because of the financial difference between me and my peers.

The French learning - although not as intense intense as a fully French school - is great and the fact that they learn Spanish in grade 4 is even better. Class sizes are small (rarely above 20 students) and there is a lot of support from different learning specialists should the child need it. Highly recommend a visit if the occasion arises",

At the time I did not know what bullying was or how much it hurts for the who is the bully and for who is being bullied.\nWhen I went into grade 4, the same kid who bullied my friend started bullying me, that was a big impact in my life. After a year of bullying,me and my family decided to leave and find a better school for me.\nI have to say my teacher knew of what was happening and nothing seemed to change; but not only was I bullied from a student but from my teacher as well!! my teacher did not encourage me in a way that was beneficial to me, instead she made me feel bad about myself because I was not able to  understand math as well as others. Still nowadays I still feel like I’m bad at math no matter what.\n\nLast week I talked to a friend about the CWS and she told me there is still bullying going on there, more then 4 kids have already left school because of bullying, from the same person and nothing still hasn’t been done.\nI feel sad for other kids who have been bullied just like me. It’s not a kid’s thing to do and it’s not ok. Waldorf school is a great place to learn in but just because it’s Waldorf doesn’t mean it will be always good.

        "text": "I was hired as a lead teacher in the kindergarten at Calgary Waldorf School four years ago. Someone I worked with made malicious complaints about my professional conduct, solely for the purpose of causing me harm. I found it extremely difficult to  weather the storm that was brought down on me.\n\nI felt humiliated by rumors in the parent community, and lost the confidence to face other teachers because I underwent an investigation due to the complaints. All this happened in the first month of my employment! Unfortunately, irreparable harm had been done, such that months later I would be confronted by an intimidating parent who wanted to start a physical altercation with me. He noted that I habitually came to school before anyone else arrived, and he waited for me. He cornered me in an empty building and was about to assault me, until he noticed my five year old daughter was with me. Thankfully, he did not perpetrate any physical harm to my body. Luckily for me, the principal was there and called the police immediately. Looking back, I can't understand how I had the strength to go through so much and still focus on my work of caring for the wellbeing of the children in my classroom.\n\nI feel grateful to have had a few class parents, colleagues, and an administrator who were still able to see the good in me and in my work with the children. They helped me through what became an uncomfortable year of struggling to recover my confidence. I don't know how else I could have survived a year in which my dignity was taken away so callously. Because of a few decent people, I would have even stayed to teach another year at the school, but I had to move away as soon as summer break started.\n\nBefore leaving Calgary Waldorf School, the principal would write me a recommendation letter to say that I \"continue to work collaboratively with [my] colleagues to provide a warm, caring and enriching environment for the young children in [the] kindergarten.\" She was the only administrator who had the humanity to reach out and acknowledge that I had gone through a lot that year, and had done so with grace.\n\nFour years on, I write this review because I'm still trying to recover from the pain and loss and grief that I went through in that intense year of teaching at CWS. I believe that the way that my situation was handled was problematic, and perhaps not entirely ethical. I've since learned how to deal with grief in a way that I can keep a healthy and productive level of self-esteem intact in the face of challenges. I guess you could say I've forgiven the school, but haven't forgotten it. That year Calgary Waldorf School left an indelible impression on me.",

        "text": "Our journey at the Calgary Waldorf School began with the Parent & Tot class 15 years ago and though our youngest of two is graduating from grade 9 in a couple of weeks, our relationship with the school will not end. That's because through all of these years, our kids have been blessed with wonderful teachers who at their core are conscientious, diligent and loving, know their students like the back of their hands, have expertise in creating a community for not just the students to learn and flourish in but for the parents to enjoy as well from class 1 on. No organization I've been involved with has as much heart, faithfulness to their longstanding guiding philosophy, and is as well run as the Calgary Waldorf School. No organization is perfect but this school learns from and responds to its trials ethically and responsibly. My kids particularly benefited from the junior high sports program which welcomes any student interested to participate in all of the sports, or as many as they want, throughout the school year. I've been involved as a coach and assistant coach on some of these teams and to see not only the growth over three years in the competence of the team but the strengthening of the student relationships through sport has been such a privilege to behold.",

        "text": "We absolutely love the Calgary Waldorf School! As a parent who was not familiar with Waldorf education at all, I am so happy to have found such a beautiful + nurturing space for my children. We were initially recommended to this school by an occupational therapist with the Children's Hospital. The Kindergarten was instrumental in our child's physical development and confidence. I credit the school's focus on sensory experiences, like outdoor play and handwork activities. Calgary Waldorf offers a lovely community for parents to connect with each other and stay involved in their children's education.\n\nI would highly recommend touring the school and talking to the parents that actually have children here if you are interested. I have yet to meet anyone here who has not been satisfied with the education their children have received. We are so lucky to have local school that recognizes play as a foundation for healthy development.",

        "text": "I do NOT recommend this place. I doubt the personnel's qualifications. It is located in a convenient location, and it is cheap, but they don't have any resources to help your child to develop through play. The teacher doesn't have the skills to manage difficult kids, and they don't promote a healthy environment for other kids. The food is low quality and has no nutritional value. The teacher gives candies to the kids to make them behave, which I found a very wrong approach, especially when they don't ask you if it is ok to give sugar to your kid. They don't care about children's feelings and emotional development. The manager is amiable and tries to listen to your concerns but inside the classroom is another story. After two weeks, I knew it was the wrong choice; I had to stay for three months waiting for an opening in another location; that was the only reason to stay. The picture of the white paper is one of my son's crafts in cancare. Even my son asked me why he was not doing any crafts or any activity anymore. He was in another daycare before, and the following picture is the kind of thing he used to do there, nothing special, but some paint and dedication make the difference. I never saw a teacher engaged with the kids in any activity besides reading a book. Not to mention it is dirty and messy; there is a mess at the entrance with everyone in the center shoes that is a total muddy mess. Kids don't have a cabinet reachable for their belongs.\nYou kid deserve better!",

We decided to stop sending him to this daycare for personal reasons. When we went to collect his belongs, which includes 2 bottles that we left there for him to use. We left the bottles there as we were promised that these would be cleaned/sanitized on a daily basis. However, we found mold in the straw in one of the bottles. Yes, mold in the clear straw. And it is a bottle that he uses everyday. We emailed the daycare just to tell them about this because we don’t want this to happen to other kids. We didn’t hear anything back, not even an apology.\nThe daycare would know who I am by reading this. We are not here to tell you to not send your kids there.

They treat each child as if they were their own, and it truly shows. My son adores them and has formed a strong bond with both of them. Their nurturing approach, patience, and ability to make learning fun have made a world of difference in his development.\n\nThey provide a diverse range of meals, ensuring that my son is not only well-fed but also exposed to different foods from a young age. It's reassuring to know that he's getting the balanced diet he needs to thrive.\n\nThe creative side of this preschool is simply amazing. My son comes home with beautiful crafts and art projects on a regular basis. It's evident that the teachers encourage his creativity and help him explore his artistic talents. The pride he takes in showing us his creations is priceless.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and enriching environment for their child. Luisa and Laura, along with the entire staff, go above and beyond to make every child feel special and cherished. I feel truly fortunate to have found such a wonderful place for my son's early education. Thank you to everyone at the preschool for the exceptional care and support you provide.",

This was the first daycare she has been to , and the staff did everything to make a smooth transition. They had floating teachers to help with the new children and give them on one one attention, the teachers all make the children feel sooooo loved and welcomed. I've observed the way that they handle conflict with other kids, and tantrums, tip-top in their empathy and de-escalating. There's a huge indoor gym where kids can play and get physical activity on colder days, and a pretty decent outdoor spot with a good assortment of age-appropriate playground equipment. They provide meals for your kids, and take them out for picnics and walks to get fresh air- weather permitting. Flexible plans for new-to-daycare parents to transition their kids (which many daycares don't allow), and they also helped during our move to accommodate her an extra day after our agreement.\nLove love love chapter 1 downtown.\n\nanother great thing thats unique about this daycare- the walls between classes go up halfway- so teachers can see each other across classes, which increases accountability and transparency and allows for easy assistance if needed in one room!\n\nand did i mention their prices are one of the cheapest, with the lowest deposit for daycares in downtown calgary?\n\nThank you Chapter one team for a wonderful time!",

My first child attended for four years, and my second child was there two years.\n\nThe staff are incredibly kind and loving to the children, and it was heartwarming to see the bonds my children created with them. Importantly, staff is generally very consistent without much turnover so you can count on stability for your child.\n\nThe Daycare layout was one of the key reasons I chose Chapter 1 back in 2018. Rather than individual enclosed rooms, it is one big wide open room, separated by low walls, bookcases, and gates. I liked the fact that caretakers were able to look over at one another, for reasons that: 1) caretakers could easy signal for help if they need support from coworkers, and 2) less private spaces = more personal security for a child. (Bonus: it was also nice that my eldest could hear her sibling, look over at him, and support him on his hard days if needed.)\n\nWe got lots of art daily, my kids learned a ton and are well set up for their next schooling endeavours, and as parents we felt very involved throughout the years. The staff went above and beyond to host holiday and milestone events with kids & parents, and I will very much miss being part of the Chapter 1 family.\n\nThank you so much for everything you've done for my kids and family.

        "text": "Disorganized and rude staff, old facilities with dirty run down carpets. The way they respond to negative reviews is exactly the way they treat parents if any issues are brought up. They will \"deny registration\" and ask you to find another daycare for your child giving you a \"sufficient notice\" of 3 days to make new arrangements. They expected us to pay a daily drop in of $50 during those days. First day they didn't expect my 1 year old. There was confusion and unattended parents and babies at the main door. My son was handed to the toddler's room caregiver and only one caregiver was looking after 7 babies in the babies area. They seemed understaffed. The toddler and baby areas were not separated by any structure and toddlers just run around everywhere. I noticed all the babies were in high chairs the entire time I was there (45 min and it wasn't during a meal), and my husband said he found them in the chairs in the afternoon too when he picked him up. Perhaps a byproduct of being short staffed that day? or the fact that the babies and toddler room are one and the same and there is no way for babies to walk around safely or sit on the floor. It made me wonder how long my baby sat in the chair the whole day. I emailed the director and stressed that Alberta requires a max of 4 babies per caregiver. They said they were compliant with that rule and that first day of the month is usually busier, hence the confusion. I went with it and sent him in again next day, but had the exact same experience. In the afternoon he came back and threw up his lunch. I emailed her and asked her to investigate and that in the meantime I would pack his food. She responded that that was prohibited (it's not allowed, explained to me as almost a breach in the law!?!) and that due to my son's \"high developmental needs\" they could not receive him anymore. She gave me 3 days to find a new daycare! She also said they would charge me $50 daily from that day on (they did refund me in full for the first month tho). I have a full time job and scrambled to find a new place for him but I am so glad I did. I didn't feel my baby was safe or happy at this daycare",

I toured a number of facilities but from the moment I entered CEC, I knew it was the right fit for our family. Our daughter absolutely loves attending and it's amazing to see how much her personality and skills have developed.\n\nAll the staff, from the director to the educators to the on-site cook, are incredible.  The educators truly care and their dedication to all aspects of child develop truly shows.  The on-site cook is second to none.  As my daughter says, all meals at the center are 'Delicious'!  Since placing my daughter on the waitlist, we've had absolutely no issues with communication from the center.  The director is always on top of her game and provides regular updates and reports to the parents.\n\nI am so happy we found Child Enrichment Center and can't recommend it enough!",

If that was different, she would still be there and I would have given a higher rating! Another parent told me that it is against the law for them to do that. I have no idea how to find out if that is true or not! I also found that she was eating the same thing there a lot, some type of soup. No idea where it came from or what was in it, that also makes me uncomfortable because nutrition is important! Also if your child gets hurt there, their procedures kind of suck. For a daycare that has been there for so long, I was surprised that they're not more on top of things like becoming more modern to keep clients. My neighbors daughter went there 30 - 40 years ago, and it doesnt seem like much has changed at all since then.",

He connected very well with the staff and they were all super friendly and caring.  It was then when I decided to register him for full time preschool. He’s learns so much everyday and the communication and daily reports from the staff shows they go above and beyond and truly love what they do and the children. It has made bedtime super easy as he says “I want to go to bed mommy so I can go to school tomorrow!” That shows me how much he truly enjoys going everyday.

        "text": "OK, after having my daughter there for a year, this is my honest opinion.\nI'll start with the good: the teachers. The only reason why my daughter stayed in that daycare for so long were the teachers. You will not find more caring and involved daycare teachers than these ones and their guidance turned her from a shy girl that wouldn't speak to an outgoing cheerful kiddo. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\nFor us that was the most important thing. For the kindness of the teachers we would have tolerated everything else a.k.a \"the bad\".\nThe bad:\nAdministration - everything they could have messed up they did. My recommendation is to have everything they say in writing.\nThey are super expensive. First they introduced a \"food fee\" of $180 on top of the fees that were there originally. If my kid eats $180 worth of food in addition to the original price, I'd expect more than soups and crackers 2x/weeks.\nThe responses to some negative reviews here will tell you more about the arrogance of the owner than I can in my short review here. (correction: they've deleted them since a few months ago when I was reading them - still indicative)\n\nIn conclusion, if you want your kid to be amongst amazing caring teachers this is the place to be. To us, everything else was secondary to that. But also be prepared to deal with semi-competent administration and ask for everything in writing.",

The centre did an awesome job throughout the pandemic, with communication, protocols, and responding to parents. This facility is beautiful, as I've heard the new location is as well.\n\nMy 4 year old says that her favourite part is doing crafts (they do them nearly every day). My 2 year old says outside (they have an awesome rooftop playground and indoor gym for smokey/cold days) and Shannon (her daycare mommy who is one of her favourite people in the world). Both of my girls love it there and have done wonderfully. A nanny would be basically the same cost for us with two kids, but I wouldn't consider it for a second. The socialization has been fantastic, and the daycare very responsive to all of my (often annoying) requests. The food is great, they are awesome at uploading information and pictures to the app, and for me it really checks all the boxes.\n\nThe only thing that I don't love is that they don't allow parents to access the video streams of the class rooms like Kids and Company does. However, they do have cameras (the parents at the time they were installed opted not to have access so you can't really blame the centre) so if there are issues, they can check. That being said, I haven't had any issues that would warrant that type of request.\n\nI also love that they have multiple locations and kindergarten options. My kids will for sure be at one of their locations until they go to school!",

Most importantly, the educators truly educate! These children are not too young for serious learning, and well-informed practices are so impressive. Unlike other childcare, this is not a place where they will just keep your child alive until you get back. The growth and learning in these tiny people is real.",

If outdoors and play-based learning is important for you -  this is the best preschool program! The projects the teachers lead are mindful, fun, and so creative. For parents starting the preschool program, my advice is to be patient at the beginning. Once the kids get to know each other and get in the groove of child-led play, the program really takes off. My other son has participated in the summer programs, and has loved them too. Highly highly recommend Common Digs.",

When I asked the nearest staff member where my daughters mitts and gloves were she immediately responded with attitude “well your child will have to keep them on.” My daughter is 3 years old, she needs to be reminded to keep her mittens on and she may even need help doing so. The staff member then said “she could have left them somewhere” we later learned that she had put them down in the park and they had gotten lost. Brand new pair of mittens and hat. I thought the low teacher-to-child ratio made a difference but apparently it does not. I’m also a person of “color” in this racist town so that could have been a factor in taking care of my child - we know we will be told otherwise but hey I just thought that bit of context would matter to other BIPOC people (iykyk). I don’t trust many child care places and this was a last straw scenario for me.",

Everyone took such good care of him and every morning when I dropped him off, he was so excited to get to his classroom. It was so hard dropping him off, but seeing his smile and how comfortable he was with all his teachers made it so much easier. The pictures that they sent through the app showed all the fun and engaging activities that they do.  They also got him to eat his meals during the day, especially his vegetables which he wasn't eating at home.  I can clearly see the love and care that everyone has for the kids and I know that my son is in good hands. In the end, it was hard to take him out because I know that he enjoys it there so much. I am so grateful that my son had the experiences at Curious Kids and I am hoping that he can return soon with his new baby brother.",

We were there right when the daycare opened, so I’m not sure if they just couldn’t find staff that wanted to work there or not. I found that the inconsistency with staff wasn’t great and my daughter would get used to one person and then all of a sudden there was another. I also found that she was sick almost constantly at this daycare…I was paying for full-time and she was there maybe half the month every month. Last, sometimes when my daughter was having a sick day, there would be updates on the app they use about how she ate a whole meal and took a nap etc. It made me feel like maybe when she was at daycare they were just updating the app to make it sound like she was eating/sleeping. Since then (January) she’s been at a home daycare and hasn’t been sick once. I know a lot of this isn’t controllable, but it was my experience.",

Really great actually, hence why I’m so frustrated its come to this and  Sadly I’ve reached heads with the management.\n\nKids were playing tag , and my son was supposedly blocked/cornered so he punched the kid feeling teased and well cornered. While I acknowledge the wrongness of this the director has failed to understand that notifying me at pick up rather then 2 Pm when it happened that she was suspending him the following day, makes it super difficult if not impossible to find last min care.\n\nI frustratedly expressed that the following work day would be much more suitable,  and allow us time to explain to our employers the situation. When she failed to see my side side;  i wanted to simply leave, to which I was informed that since I couldn’t see her side and fully agree that only she was right, and that we’ve butted heads over a small fee miscommunication in the past she no longer wanted my son in her program , leaving me with 5 days to find a new program.\n( but my daughter can stay ?)\nI will no longer be dealing with the management here, and will leave all future dealings with them\nUp to the wife, as my daughter still attends here. Threatening or promising to remove my son at month end because I was frustrated about the time of choice, and wanting to come back when we were both calmer is a  Very unprofessional way to end a relationship, let alone one with a child.\n\nSo if you’ve read this far , y’a 3-5 stars from a kids point of view depending on the day , but 1 star on my part for the way management just handled this.",

It was the most difficult thing for me to move Aden to another day care.\nAden was treated like their own child, he had so many caring teachers. He learnt the most important basics and I am so happy for the 2 years he spent there which set him up well for his move to other ventures ahead in life.\n\nI remember Ms Mariyama, Ms Nabel , Ms Joan and Ms Harman for all the love and care they have Aden in his time there.\n\nWe will be dropping by to meet and greet as he grows older.\nAll the best, your day care is more than a day care with genuine, loving caregivers.\nRohit and Dipti .\n( I have attached his farewell card , it was so moving to see the love in words, thank you for the amazing culture and real words)",

Our son, is often slow to adjust to new situations and people, so it was a big change when we moved him and his sister from a dayhome to here. Since that time, he has become much better adapted and matured in so many ways since being enrolled. Thanks to the dedicated owner and the lovely staff, as you can tell it’s a very positive and cohesive team. Dropping my children off is now 1000% less stressful as we know both our son and daughter are in very caring hands and are happy at drop off time. Keep up the good work in the staff you employ and also in maintaining quality and care in the educational programs provided.",

I worked in another room. My daughter was allowed to play with scissors and cut up all her pairs of pants they wouldn't help her use the potty.  I was bullied by my own boss at this daycare. The husband didn't have his level one and had to have me and his wife Julia to do the questions and answers for him because he doesnt know how to speak well English or understand much English because he wasn't allowed to take this kids in the van alone without his level one child care at the time Licensing came and to tell Julia that I had to take all the kids out of the van at very stop but they said that was to much work and that we shouldn't have to do that. They never washed the toys. They wouldn't make enough food for the kids to eat. They always were still hungry at the time but Julia said that's all they had for them. One another time I wasn't walking the children and children told me something that happened and the another worker should have reported it as she seen it happen and Julia locked me in her office till I wrote a statement for something I didn't see. I cried in the office till I was supposed to pick up another children from the school bus. I wiped my tears away and still went to go get the child and than I came back she put me back into her office till I wrote it as there wasn't anyone in my room watching the children so I went back to the children finished the day. The next day I gave my two weeks notice and took my daughter out of that daycare ASAP. Her husband didn't even know how to speak English well so truly. So if you think about putting your kids with this daycare just remember her husband didn't get his level one without his wife and I having to answer questions as I had to go to school for it. He had no schooling for child care when I went there.\n\nI truly don't recommend this daycare.",

My grand baby always came home starving. They fed him very little. He was sent home with other kids diapers, clothes. The daycare would not let you come in to the daycare. You had to wait outside. We live close by so when my son in law watched him play outside at the daycare he was told he was not allowed to watch. The staff are rude to the parents . My grandson was being hit by another child in the daycare and they did nothing about it. But most of all my grand baby would cry when they dropped him off so something was going on , he feared this daycare. He is now in a new daycare that sends pics of all his activities, what he ate etc. he is very happy. I would not consider this daycare  at all",

My son enrolled at 10 months and I'm so glad I chose Edgemont because they have made his daycare experience the best. He's happy getting to daycare (gets excited and claps his hands when he sees the daycare sign) but is still happy to come home with us haha. One of the daycare ladies treats my son like her own son!

My son seems very happy there and he adjusted well to the transition. They always seem to go the extra mile at Expanding Imaginations and I am so happy we found a spot at this day care!",

Their dedication, kindness and professionalism is incredible. Our son thrived here. Their in-house chef created delicious food, our son ate everything. The staff have been here for years, so there is very little teacher turnover. The variation in rooms and options of indoor exercise rooms and a magic room were wonderful in the cold Calgary winters.

And about the events, I don't have any concerns because they are flexible and open-minded. For example, on Halloween, I told them I’m not particularly eager to send my kids this day, and they accept that in a very welcome way.

        "text": "TLDR: The people at the head of this company do not care about your children’s wellbeing. Do not be fooled by the marketing team’s stellar job of selling you this childcare program. From the money hungry management’s total lack of empathy to a full-blown e coli outbreak which has hospitalized many children, this is not a safe place to send your kids. Stay far away from Fueling Brains Academy.\n\nFueling Brains. You are a childcare organization. You are not a tech giant. You are not Google, or Meta, or Apple. You hold responsibility for the wellbeing and development of children. They rely on you just as their parents rely on you to take their children’s care seriously. There is absolutely no excuse for running a company in this line of business with the intention to maximize profit, scale up and reap the rewards at the expense of young lives and their parent’s wallets. Your goals should not be centered around growth at all costs. You are a childcare organization.\n\nFueling Brains Academy has sold out your children, substituting quality childcare to infect themselves with a toxic malady that plagues so many businesses of the 21st century: the idea that appearances are more valuable than implementation.\n\nI speak from experience. My child attended Fueling Brains. This company is responsible for the hospitalization of children enrolled at their Calgary campuses due to an e coli outbreak they neglected to prevent. A lot more than just bad food has been served up to our kids though. How about a side of permanent organ damage and weeks in the hospital on dialysis? Do not let these crooks get away with what they have done. Do not allow their finely tuned marketing machine to erase this atrocity from the records. Do not let them skirt their responsibility.\n\nThe food my child and countless others were being served every day was being prepared in a kitchen that had a known cockroach infestation and was not being cleaned properly with bleach or the mandatory sanitization products. This food was then being transported in non-temperature controlled vehicles, five days a week. Fueling Brains may be embedded in their branding, but do not be fooled. They’ve managed to fuel our kid’s healthy bodies with sickness and disease in equal measure - source: https://ephisahs.albertahealthservices.ca/facilitydetails/?id=a2deaeb4-e1f3-e811-a977-000d3af490cc&fbclid=IwAR2tDbeVMUDoWJ1xpbTzCALJyi38TY85Ps8LD4Mt4QfP20DI__f-CoB1NLs\n\nWhat started as an honest effort under the former “Kids U” brand, where the aim was to give your children a Montessori and Reggio inspired learning environment that put their needs first, has become corrupted by greed. It is my opinion that the leadership should be thrown in jail for the way they’ve run this company into the ground and put countless lives in danger.\n\nSince their quest for expansion began, Fueling Brains has outsourced most of its administrative jobs to places like Texas and India, looking to cut cost, find tax loopholes and, essentially, earn themselves as much money as possible. The implementation of their educational programming has declined as a result of their priority shift. This is not the same institution it once was. They claim to be looking out for your kid’s best interests yet are so far removed from the City of Calgary it’s no surprise that they were so oblivious to the violations occurring in their own kitchens. They know precisely what they are doing when it comes to making money, these people are not daft. Your child's wellbeing, however? They could care less.\n\nTo each and every one of you operating above the primary care staff (who are the real unsung heroes, by the way), I hope you realize the damage you’ve caused to honest families and innocent children. Perhaps your disgrace will cause you to live the rest of your professional lives with a sullied reputation. Perhaps you'll learn some sort of lesson from what you've done. Best of luck to you in legal hell. Maybe all that money you made selling out innocent kids and their families will get you out of it.",

Many of the days off are not stat holidays and leave parents scrambling to take off work.\nThe communication leaves something to be desired as well. They are not clear and concise about any decisions made to schedules or fees. They require 30 days notice of change in schedule, along with admin fees, but don't abide by their own terms when they want to make a change.\nOverall, I feel robbed. I feel they did my child a disservice by making this about fueling their pockets, instead of fueling brains.\nThe teachers are wonderful, management is abysmal, and this probably explains the high turn over in teachers in the recent months.\nWould not recommend.",

We used to refer this location to friends when run by Jocelyn but have been left frantically searching for other childcare. Our friends who have been referred have also left.\n\nThe classrooms have exploded with kids in the recent years. There are a few amazing teachers (Jesse, Elijah, Diane) but they are understaffed, under resourced and seem to often run over their ratios.\n\nThe KidsU head office is impossible to reach. You can call their their entire directory and no one will pick up. Emails will often be ignored and the campuses/parents are left to fend for themselves.\n\nThey will offer referral programs that will not be honoured. You can sense an overall sentiment that KidsU is focus on running a profitable business rather than passionate about childcare.\n\nThey introduced a new program for the junior level that shifts the children three times a day and constantly breaks up the cohort of children into different groups. The class size is 37. With teachers seeing three different sets of kids, as different groups, each day, you can tell they are struggling to create any personal bonds. The children are moved around at a pace that they don’t remember teachers names and are left without personal connections.\n\nFeedback was shared directly with the program administrators to highlight the challenges in their new program but there isn’t much influence at the campus level.\n\nWe’re happy to be moving on to a new daycare. KidsuU was great up to 2021 but has really lost its way.",

        "text": "I worked as an speech and language aid for certain kids (through another company) at Fueling Brains West 85th for the entire 2022-2023 school year. Here are some alarming things I noticed that I want to share with parents if they plan on or already have their kids enrolled in this school.\n\n1. Kids are not looked after and there are MULTIPLE safety hazards. Many times while doing speech activities with my assigned children, I would have to jump in to make sure the kid jumping of the table didn’t break his head open, or get I would have to get a kid away from trying to break a glass jar. Often, there were too many kids in a classroom (up to 48 children with 6 teachers) for the teachers to pay attention to important safety issues the kids were having. Kids regularly got hurt at this facility.\n\n2. Kids hit, punch, bite, kick, and hurt each other daily. Most teachers would not notice these instances, again because there are so many kids in the classroom, and if they were noticed, sometimes the wrong kid would get in trouble. This is pretty dangerous, and again, I would sometimes jump in (during my speech activities) to help the safety of the children even though it was not my job.\n\n3. Teachers would often yell at the children and use harsh words with them. This is because there was always so much going on and the teachers were frustrated, but it still gave the wrong message to the children.\n\n4. Super high staff turn over. In the 1 year I was there, I saw between 15-25 teachers leave, and only 5 or 6 were there from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. The environment of the school is quite stressful and exhausting, so teachers get burned out easily.\n\nWith all this said, I think it would be a good idea to keep away from Fueling Brains, as I was genuinely concerned for children's safety and well-being while at the school.",

The teachers' unwavering love, care, and involvement made her time there truly remarkable. The professionalism in management ensures a safe and enriching environment.\n\nDuring our daughter's autism diagnosis process, the daycare staff's support was invaluable. They guided us with compassion and understanding, making a challenging time more manageable. As we bid farewell to this incredible place, we're grateful for the core memories it has given our daughter.\n\nHappyTime isn't just a daycare; it's a haven of love and growth. Our deepest gratitude to the entire HappyTime family for their dedication and impact on our lives.",

        "text": "Terrible experience - we toured the facility and they seemed great. One week prior to starting, I inquired about if they had air conditioning, and if not, how they ensured the health and safety of the children in regards to not overheating (it was during a heat wave). I was informed that they did not have any \"fancy temperature measuring devices\" and that no parents had every inquired about it before. If it was hot, they moved in a portable air conditioning unit or opened windows. They determined if it was hot by if the teachers were hot or not. They had no policies in place regarding acceptable temperature ranges for inside (they had rules around outside), nor digital thermometers in the class rooms. I highlighted to them that Calgary had several heat waves over the last two summers, and that other child care facilities that I contacted (including our current one) had air conditioning and a clear policy on the health and safety of the children during heat waves. I was fine with them not having air conditioning, but I needed to know that the room could be maintained at a safe temperature. They could not tell me what the maximum or average temperatures would be in the room, during heat waves.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, I was informed that it was clear I didn't trust them enough to care for my child, so we were not suited for their facility, and they returned my deposit. This left me scrambling to find child care with one week's notice. In discussing this with licensing and health, I was assured that this was a legitimate issue to be inquiring on.\n\nNo child care provider will have my blind trust, and I would expect that every provider would be able to answer basic health and safety questions. Thankfully I was able to get into an alternative facility that was not at all put off when I inquired about how they ensured the health and safety of my child when in their care. Heat waves are a normal part of Calgary summers now, and excessive heat exposure for vulnerable persons (inc children) can be a significant health threat. I am super glad that we are not going to be attending a facility that expects my blind trust when unable to address what should be a simple question (ie. yes, we have digital thermometers in each room, and ensure that they temperature is maintained below 28 degrees during heat waves).",

She learned the alphabets, numbers, simple maths, writing with a pen/pencil, natures like the bugs, plants, and butterflies.  She also learned to take turns, make friends, and play along with others.  Daily picture updates from the teachers on the apps are great.  All in all, Joso is great.

The teachers really love being around the children and it shows. My son always has a smile on his face and has never woken up in 3 years and didn’t want to go. They have exceeded my expectations for reading and writing. He will be going to grade one next year fully able to read level 1 and 2 books independently and can write full sentences. This learning has not come at the expense of free play or creativity. He has told me that he loves having the free play time to be happy and a kid! They have lots of interesting programs and experiences, and I am always amazed how much he is learning disguised as fun. They allow the kids to be curious and creative, and bottom line, I feel safe and comfortable knowing how happy his first experience with school is. My son even has a yoga stretch and meditation practice he enjoys that he learned in school. If you are looking for a place that your child is safe, loved, and happy this is the place for you. This has easily been the hands down best choice we have made for our child!",

The good things about it is that it has an indoor playground, nice and bright rooms. Teachers and supporting staff, most of them, are nice. However, the rooms are not clean. Kids' shoes often found in their beddings or storage for spare cloths. You will find dirt, trash in kids's bedding every Friday when you take it home. You will see teachers are switched everyday between different rooms. Morning and afternoon teachers are also different.

It was a very difficult time for us but Ms. Brenda suggested for him to get tested for being gifted and supported us through the whole journey. She suggested various activities for my son to do during school so that he would stay engaged. All thanks to her, he enjoys his time at Joso's and learned so much socially and academically. I recommend Ms. Brenda and her kinder room to everyone I meet. He was at a very famous private school earlier but had difficult time because he could not fit in. Being in Ms.Brenda's classroom made me realize again how important the educator is. She genuinely loves children and you can see how much she enjoys working with them. The children know this for sure so they love her right back! If it weren't for her, my son would still have difficult time at school and we would be struggling. Thank you so much Ms. Brenda and Ms. Bethany!",

My oldest would cry everyday and he didn’t wanted to go which later I learned that the teachers would hit him in the hand for crying. One day I was at work and my youngest was a little sick when I dropped them off in the morning asked my sister to check on him around 1030 in the morning when she went their she witnessed that at that time they have putten all the kids for nap at 1030 which suppose to be 1200. I don’t know how they have this 5 star review but I took my kids out of their and registers in to another daycare and never had any issue with kids going their they would walk by themselves happily so parents just check in your kids randomly hopefully your kids doesn’t have to suffer as my kids did 😊",

This is extremely serious!\nSo if you live in Calgary southeast and want your kid(s) to receive a great childcare, with strong moral values in a very respectful place, with lovely and professional staff that shows that your child matters you, should definitely book a tour there and chat with Miss Karen!\nOther aspects that I really appreciate are:\n- Cleanliness of the kitchen and the whole place in general.\n- English skills: my son didn’t speak english well when he started, but now he is confident to talk in English everywhere, even to teach me and my husband sometimes 😅\n- They are very accommodating with the process of potting training for each child.\n- Grant & subsidy available\nI definitely love the Kiddies Daycare Center SE, their approach and the fact that they share my values and principles of life!

I wrote a letter to them about how negligence they are. Good they had camera so that I picked her up after watching their camera .

These activities directly impacted the very smooth transition into Kindergarten for our older child and set them up for success.

Fortunately, they were ready for our kids to return when we needed them and we have never once worried about their safety.\n\nI would highly recommend them anyone to that is looking for a high quality daycare.  The facility is spotless, there is a nice secure play area for the children outside, the rooms are large, you can access the building from the +15 and there are designated parking stalls on the ground level for easy drop-off.\n\nWe will miss them when our kids are in school but we will be taking advantage of the summer program for school aged children because we appreciate the way they simplify our lives that much.",

If considering daycare, I highly recommend Kids & Go.",

The daily reports are detailed for each child with accompanying pictures.  The activities and meals are well thought out and the webcam access is a nice feature.\nWhen we moved, Mimi assisted us with the transfer to another location and after a miserable experience at the other location, (where you were treated like a number rather than a human), Mimi was kind and efficient to help with our transition back to Livingston.\nEven with the commute, we are very happy for the oppourtunity to be back at Livingston.  It's a friendly place where ALL of the educators will know your child's name, what interests them, what to say if they are upset and are excited to do it.",

Old toys and old tools even the outdoor areas was not good at all. They were  putting a boy who was crawling in the toddler room where the kids running and walking and he was crying continuously through the day and the teachers did nothing for him. He broke my heart and i was surprised because they asked us to wait in the waiting list tell our daughter exactly 18 months so she can be accepted in the toddler program. We were there only during the transition week and I didn’t put my daughter there but of course they didn’t give us our money back. We lost 500$ because we choosed not to continue with thim.

We feel incredibly lucky to have received the love and care for both our children (like they were their own) and they were legitimately a part of our family for the last 6 years.  Caretakers would take the time to share unique traits or milestones they noticed in our children and we could tell they were as invested in their development as we were.  Also due to the capacity of their location we felt a large sense of community from the other families who were also at this location.

The space is absolutely beautiful - spacious, bright and open with so much room for little ones to run around and explore. The ECEs are so loving and tender with our kiddos. They get to know each one's personality so well and see the best in them like we do. The staff have seemingly endless energy that they bring to caring for the kids. They come up with creative activities to stimulate learning and growth, they have dance parties and do tons of singing. They celebrate birthdays and special occasions with a ton of enthusiasm and fun. The kids are super active all day and the space facilitates this well. My little one went through a period of time where he was biting other kids and it was so tough for me as his mom but ultimately we got through it with lots of communication and support from the staff.

She was always encouraged to be herself and the staff always kept in good contact and good relationship with the parents. On top of it all, they feed the kids healthy organic foods made onsite. Nothing but good things to say for The Pumpkin Patch.",

They let the kids explore and learn through the daily indoor and outdoor activities. I have met with the teachers and the manager many times and they were very patient, well educated, and experts in their job. My son loves his teachers and friends A LOT!! he keep saying their names and gets so excited in the morning! It has been less than 6 months since my son started at this daycare, and I can see the huge improvements in his language, communication, motor skills, and behavior.

At the beginning, my husband and I wasn’t sure if we will register our kids here, because some bad reviews on google. However, we took time to go to the daycare to observe the place, the activities with the kids and to talk with Ms. Francey, not only about the kid’s programs but also about the bad comments. She explained to me why some parents wrote those comments; she also promised to take care of my children as they were her own. We decided to give to her a chance, because she said that she is Christian and we also prefer Christian daycares. I’d never regretted it, because Ms. Francey kept her promise and she also proof her faith in many other ways. She helped us not only to follow special diets for our kids, but also to provide the Montessori program and all the other services for free, when we didn’t have money to pay. I know that Ms. Francey also helped other families that had financial trouble during the covid pandemic. Finally, we decided to homeschool our kids to do what God commanded us to do with them, which also helps our finances, but my kids will always affectionately remember Ms. Francey and other teachers that took good care of them. My children also loved many friends and activities with them in the daycare and Montessori program. It was a great blessing for our family; we are all very thankful and we recommend this daycare with no doubt.",

And doesn't want to come home at the end of the day. The development that my daughter has achieved is more than I expected. Teachers are caring, high trained and very inventive. I like the weekly pictures and updates that we receive by email about our child activities throughout the week. The daycare offers structured schedule that include plenty of time for physical activities, educational activities and quite time. I also appreciate that kids are served with nutritionally balanced meals and snacks. I’m very satisfied with Kids R Fun day care and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for safe, caring, fun and educational place for their kids.",

Everything about this facility is A+++.\n\nThe facility is beautiful, you can tell that they really care about the kids education as well as having fun. Not only do they have a lovely outdoor space for the children they have completely transformed the garage space to an area where the kids can play on those really cold/rainy days. That room consists of individual shops so the kids can play make believe as well as a ball pit! Come on, what child doesn’t love a ball pit?!? The rooms are also equipped with everything the kids need to have a fun filled day.\n\nAll food is made in house by Faye, food is nutritious and food that the kids want to eat! I’m talking spaghetti, lasagna, roasted chicken, pizzas (home made) and even themed food. Thanksgiving, the kids are having a traditional Turkey dinner! And if your child doesn’t like something (my daughter is a very picky eater), Faye always accommodates!\n\nWhen my son started at Kids World just before he turned 2 he wasn’t talking, I was actually getting a little concerned that he was speech delayed. But no, the team brought those words right out of him, he’s talking non stop now after just a month of being at this daycare. Not only is he now a talking machine, they are also teaching him FRENCH! I wasn’t joking, they are amazing! My daughter is 5 and started when she was 4, already pretty advanced for her age I have noticed significant improvements in my daughters vocabulary and communication since going to this daycare.  Oh! And they’ve started potty training my son AT 2!!! Amazing !\n\nThey really treat you like family here, this was my children’s second home and they were very comfortable with the facility and the staff. I used to pick up my kids pretty late and I would always see the staff cleaning and disinfecting, so there’s definitely no worries when it comes to the cleanliness of the facility!\n\nI’ve since moved from Calgary and this is daycare and the staff are the only things I miss about Calgary. I wish I could have taken them back to Toronto with me!\n\nTo the Kids World team, I know you are reading this! The kids and I love you all dearly and miss you!  You all are amazing and heaven sent. Don’t stop caring for children the way you do. You were a blessing to me and my family and I can’t thank you enough for treating my kids like your own and becoming family in our hearts.",

Second, the staff are professionally trained and their CPR and First Aid accreditations are all posted outside the director's office. We need that for our asthmatic daughter. My daughter ❤️ love this daycare. She is always excited to go to this place everyday. The teachers are awesome. The teachers have lots of activities for her. There are countless times that  the teachers spotted my child having an asthma attack and they administered lifesaving inhalers for her right away. I am truly grateful 🙏 to all of them. My child is the only one hence its hard for her to share and took her awhile to build friendship with other kids. But with the help of the teachers she is now very friendly and kind to all the kids wherever she goes. I highly recommend this place so far. They even helped me to organize her first birthday party after the peak of pandemic. I highly recommend this place.",

        "text": "Kinderhaus Academy has been an incredible experience for my son.  As a teacher myself I am incredibly impressed with the school.  His growth and development over the last year was astounding. Geetha is an incredible educator with a wealth of knowledge of child development and it shows with the patience and compassion she has while challenging the children. My son’s confidence has soared. His social skills, self discipline and curiosity has grown by leaps and bounds. Kinderhaus has  a strong sense of what Montessori truly is and it shows with the calm, content and engaged children when you walk into the school. I have nothing but the highest regards for Kinderhaus. As a parent nothing compares to knowing your children are in such wonderful hands when you are at work.",

My daughter had a hard time adjusting since she is new to being with someone else aside from me, she got kicked out after the 4th date because I strongly asked for Ms. NICOLE to help me break her out of the routine of expecting me to pick her up everytime she cries.  Also,  if you tried and asked her to find ways to soothe your child like other caregivers/teacher who are patient, please dont, she will take that personally and your child will be kicked out. It is not an easy feeling for my self as a mother , having to go through alot with my daughter and for the first time ever, trying to introduce her to the outside world and came across such an uncompassionate person like Ms. NICOLE.  PLEASE IF YOU DONT HAVE THE LOVE AND PATIENCE FOR CHILDREN, GET A DIFFERENT JOB!",

I was amazed.\n- I have noticed improvement in my daughter’s socializing skills.\n- If you don’t speak English at home, learning experience would be a great help for your kid.\n- Management and staff are nice and supportive.\n- Clean environment and clean washroom.\n\nI am sure there are more positive points than what I have remembered and listed.

The teachers smiled everytime talking about him. Unfortunately we moved and had to find a closer daycare to our home but we would have loved to stay and thus highly recommend this daycare.

Before finding this beautiful outdoor center, we tried lots of daycare all over the city. They were always missing something: better communication, potty training, outdoor space, passion. Little Forest Dwellers has it all. Beside having a huge, and incredible outdoor space and focusing into lots of nature, we love their commitment, sense of community and support, communication system, and passion for kids.\nI know its hard to find a place that you trust while at the same time wanting to pursue your professional dreams or other compromises. You want a place that offers an equal or better learning environment than the one you have at home. That's what really value about them. They have that (I could never build a backyard like the one they have LOL) + all the staff is so passionate about it.\nWe love them and couldn't recommend it enough!",

The Academy is very much different from other daycares is that they focus on teaching the kids basic foundational skills ( such as activities to help improve and fine and gross motor coordination skills) .  The preschool kids are involved in a variety of purposeful activities that help stimulate their logical (learning the alphabet/numbers, learning different topics such as earth day, etc)  and creative side (growing vegetables in their garden, yoga classes, etc.).  In addition, they also teach the kids in how to manage manage and regulate their emotions by teaching them early techniques of meditation and breathing exercises which is something you don't see in many other daycare facilities.

It's a very convenient location in the Bowness Community Centre and they spend a lot of time outdoors and in the Centre's gym.

        "text": "As a parent, I have a completely different perspective on the daycare and I feel compelled to share my thoughts in response to Jamie's review. While I understand that Jamie's experience may not have been positive, I want to highlight some important aspects that were overlooked.\n\nFirst and foremost, I have  been extremely pleased with the staff and the owner of the daycare. They have been consistently attentive, caring, and professional throughout my child's time there. The dedication and passion they demonstrate in their work is commendable.\n\nRegarding the incident during nap time, it's important to consider that children may sometimes misinterpret or misconstrue statements made by educators. I trust that the daycare staff would not intentionally say anything hurtful or promote gender bias. However, I appreciate Jamie bringing this to our attention, and I'm confident that the daycare management will address the matter appropriately.\n\nRegarding the food, I acknowledge that individual preferences can vary. However, it's important to note that the daycare makes an effort to provide nutritious meals for all children. I have personally witnessed the staff ensuring a balanced and healthy diet for the kids, taking into account dietary restrictions and allergies.\n\nRegarding the disciplinary actions witnessed by Jamie, it's crucial to maintain a safe and disciplined environment for all children. While it may be distressing for some kids to witness disciplinary measures, it's important to understand that the staff's intention is to teach valuable lessons and promote positive behavior. I have seen instances where the staff handles disciplinary matters with fairness and sensitivity.\n\nI want to emphasize that my child has had a positive experience at this daycare. The nurturing environment, engaging activities, and supportive staff have played a significant role in his growth and development. It's unfortunate that Jamie's perception differs from mine, but I believe it's important to consider multiple perspectives when evaluating the quality of a daycare.\n\nIn conclusion, I respect Jamie's decision to share their experience, but I wanted to offer my own perspective as a parent who has been satisfied with the daycare services. Each child's experience can be unique, and I believe it's essential for parents to visit the daycare, interact with the staff, and make an informed decision based on their own observations and the needs of their child.",

        "text": "My son went to this daycare during  kindergarten and now he is about to finish grade one.  Every time we drive by the centre he keeps telling me a year later how much he hated it. I’ve debated writing a review but since he continues to tell me how bad his experience was at this daycare I’m impelled to write some of his feedback that he says about his time at this centre.\n\nOne thing I reported as a parent to his teacher after he came home one day distraught;  was how upset he was because one of the educators watching his class during nap time told them all that “girls are better than boys”    This was extremely unprofessional and hurtful. My son is quite sensitive and always wants to be good so he took it very hard and personal. Even though he was listening and trying to be quiet.\n\nOther things he’s expressed and shared about being there was how awful the sandwiches and wraps were to eat at lunch. He found the food unappealing.\n\nHe witnessed other kids who were being “bad” getting yelled at and taken to the office for punishment. This made him feel uneasy and felt bad for these kids who he could hear still getting yelled at in the office. Overall he found some of the staff to be rude, mean and very strict to all the kids.\n\nI’m writing this for my son as he doesn’t want other kids to experience what he saw and went through and always says what a horrible place it was for him for that one year.  He never was one of the “bad kids” just the one witnessing how other troubled kids were treated and doesn’t feel like things were handled right.\n\nHe asked if we could give it 0 stars but unfortunately we can’t. It concerns me as a parent as he’s never been this strong about his feelings towards any of his previous daycares or after school programs.  This is why I wanted to share a review from a child’s perspective.",

We talked with him and discussed not using bad words. He would even tell his teacher he talked with us about it (as she told me)\nThey told me after the second time if it didn't stop they would have to take further action. I was in tears... how do I fix something I'm not seeing. The next day I got a call saying he swore and he's no longer welcome. I was floored... I payed for a month and there was a week left in the month. They said no he could not come back. When I tried to ask for help.. what can we do what are they doing I was given 0 help. Told that they told him not to do it and that was all. That's not how we help children... I was so disappointed in the lack of support from a place that takes care of my child while I'm trying to work.\nWhen we started a new daycare there was 0 swearing, however when the teacher would try to correct something he would jump and say please don't spank me.\n\nThis tells me there was some way more serious things happening at this daycare and I would very much NOT recommend you sending your child here.",

Not sure if standard in this industry but in 3.5 years my son had maybe 6 different teachers.\n\nThe dumpster-fire level of bad: the director, Crystal, is the most inept creature you will deal with. Always an excuse for everything instead of owning her mistakes, very limited communication on staff change (your kids will be handled by someone who didn’t introduce herself), and currently I’m fighting to get my deposit refund. The owner is not much better. 5 months later, I only got half of it without any explanation.\n\nIn short, Little Stars is great for your kids but you will not want to deal with its management.\n\nEDIT - The highly unprofessional answer from the owner says a lot. Trying to coerce their customers into removing their reviews and threaten legal action is not good business practice especially not when the review is not false.\n\nThat being said:\nI managed to recover my full deposit.\n4+ months of patience and good faith led me nowhere.

One important aspect for parents is the ability to rate daycare facilities, as it helps others make informed decisions. Since January, both of my children have been enrolled in their programs, and I am pleased to share that they are happy and even eager to attend daycare, even on weekends.\n\nHowever, recently I noticed many turnovers of teachers or staff members being reassigned to different classes. This has presented a challenge for the children, as they had already established a level of trust with their previous teachers. The previous teachers were familiar with the children's behaviours and had done an exceptional job providing care. Everything was running smoothly under their guidance.\n\nWith the introduction of new staff members may result in a transition period where they need time to adapt to their roles and responsibilities effectively. As a consequence, your child may encounter challenges in adjusting to these changes and may not receive the same level of consistent care as before. Despite this drawback, I want to emphasize that overall, this daycare is still great!",

I wasn’t provided with all the paperwork up front and all the questions I was asking would have been answered had she simply provided me with the parent handbook at the start, but I had to ask for it (once i found out one should exist, I didn’t even know there should have been one provided).

There was an instance when they lost a kid and then it was found by a stranger.Staff rotation is constant, seems like the management is bad. That shows in how cheap they are in everything: from getting kids supplies like diapers etc (which is often non existent) to what and when they feed them. There is no dedicated cook, the cook is supposed to divide their time between working alongside other teachers and preparing food/cleaning up duties. It results in terrible meal quality  and the feeding schedule theu provide DOES NOT  mix with reality. Just ask your kid. All the food is no name,low quality, watered down can soups etc etc. Stay away unless in absolute childcare emergency, don't be fooled by the fake professionalism outside and the good neighborhood",

They have a curriculum in place and we have seen our daughter grow in many ways. She looks forward to going to daycare. This was our first time dealing with a daycare and we are glad that it went smoothly. Highly recommend!",

I like that they use an app so I'm able to see my child's progress through the day and they also send msgs about the weekly lessons. This enables me to encourage more learning at home! :)\n\nOne big thing I notice is he doesn't get that sick compared to other kids I know in different daycare centres.

There are four major reasons why my family chose here after touring many daycare places. First, this place is located in a walk-out basement, which allows lots of sunlight in the classroom. Second, there is an amazing playground in the backyard; children may enjoy snow slide in Winter. Third, parents have an access to a CCTV camera in the classroom and can see their child anytime via their cell phone. This really attracted me because I am the person who is always worried about her child. But now I barely watch it because I realized there was not much to worry about. The last reason is that they provide healthy food for breakfast and lunch. I really appreciate the effort. Thank you Sojay, Ani and Young! :)",

Is the owners friends writing them?\nRead the 1 star reviews folks, whatever the 5 stars say couldn't possibly be enough to cover a missing 3 year old and several improper care warnings.\nI'm not sure why there aren't systems in place to stop the kids leaving by accident but the set up in our daycare means are kids never wandering off to the outside world.\nBuild a fence. Get a double door system. Basic childcare facilities have these in place for a reason. Totally unacceptable.",

The setting was very well organized and food was very nutritious. There were so many activities offered on a daily basis including outdoor walk (weather appropriate of course). One thing that really stood out for us was that this daycare used the \"dailyconnect app\" that updated our kid's activities, food intake ,etc, and shared his photos daily. I was very excited to check the app everyday to know what my boy was up to. Very impressive!\n\nOur boy loved this daycare so much. If we didn't move we would definitely continue to let our kid stay here. Highly recommend this daycare!",

I received a reply from \"Jane Jeanette\" asking for me to come in to the establishment to discuss the rates. I replied stating I would prefer finding out the rates prior to coming in because I have two children, one being a newborn.. I get a reply back from Jane again stating this:\n\n\"If I love my children, I will care about the place they will pass the day more than will care for the fees\"\n\nI called the daycare right away to try and speak with a manager or owner, there was no answer so I left a voicemail. Then I received a call right back from the daycare, and I asked if this was the person I was speaking to by email. She said yes. I asked if there was a manager at all, she said yes, I asked if she was the manager, and she said yes. I voiced my concerns stating how unprofessional that comment was and how she basically insinuated I don't love my children because I won't bring my immunocompromised child in to an establishment that could potentially have sick children. Obviously I was upset about the whole situation and ended the call. She called back right away to apologize for it stating she made a mistake and if I wanted to speak with the owner or manager I would need to come in to discuss it with them.i told her I was not coming in. I told her I would need to get their contact information which she refused to give because she flat out told me she doesn't want them to know about our encounter. She stated she was a volunteer and wasn't even an employee, and I asked her why she would say she was a manager then? She said the manager wasn't there so she is one. She basically kept telling me she wasn't going to let them know about the encounter and did not give me any contact information. I contstantly asked her name and she wouldn't give it to me.\n\nAbsolutely the worst experience I have ever encountered at a daycare. STAY AWAY!!!!!",

The school is run by compassionate and caring administrators and teachers who truly love what they do. It's no surprise there is very low teacher turnover.

The school admin forwarded my complaint to a teacher, other teachers/staff were not informed of my concern. My daughter's last day involved 4 girls bullying her class at recess again. My daughter tried to talk to Mr B. (teacher on duty) but he was dealing with another incident. Note that morning at 8:30 am I had emailed Ms. Massey (school administration) about a grade 3 students inappropriate behaviour upon us arriving at school. It took the school more than a day to return my email/call. Ms Massey claimed it was because she was researching the situation. Our conversation stopped when she denied that I had called in October. (I have an email from the school confirming my call).\n\nSuggest any parent review court documents regarding the school before making a commitment.",

Two of my children are currently attending this school and I don't have any negative things to say about it! They are thriving and doing so well. I truly appreciate the passion that the owner, Mrs. Debaar, put into this place. She truly cares about the children, the staff and the montessori way of life. It is a truly authentic montessori experience. I appreciate that there are many events that encourage the parents' involvements (ie. parent's night, afternoon tea, etc). The school also has special events like the Gala, Winter Wonderland, Family Picnic, etc. I also appreciate that my children barely gets sick from school! This is more of a preschool where kids are encouraged to be independent, self-directed, but also caring for one another. All the children must be potty-trained and bring their own lunches. I think this helps with lowering sicknesses and as well as the costs. I find this place very affordable in comparison to other daycares/preschools. It was more cost efficient to keep my eldest here for kindergarten full time than putting her in a halfday kindergarten and then paying additional costs for before & after school care. Overall, I only have good things to say about this school! It is a wonderful place to start buiding solid montessori foundations for the children.",

We've had a couple parent/teacher reviews since he started, and they have been able to supply feedback on how he's developing, adjusting to the environment, and learning. The staff are all very well trained to handle the children as well as teach in the Montessori way. Each classroom has at least 1 fully trained Montessorian, and ~3 other teachers to help with the kids. The kids know their routine and the day seems to progress smoothly. Throughout the year there are field trips, classroom events, school events, everything you would expect from a school. We have been very pleased with how our son has adapted and how he is developing and learning. The facility and materials are clean and well maintained. I'd love to send my daughter here when she gets old enough. Highly recommend.",

My kids are far more intelligent than other kids when they eventually started kindergarten. I still take my twin boys to their after school program. The teachers are awesome, very comforting and use gentle approach with the children. The daycare environment is very clean, tidy, and quiet. They teach the kids math,geography, arts, drawings, reading, and letters. I do not regret taking my kids to this daycare. I will definitely recommend this daycare to anyone 100%.

She is very strong willed and was very hard for her previous childcare to handle because she would act out, hitting and biting other children. Within a month of her transfer to MLC I could see a huge improvement. The owner of MLC is a huge part of learning plans and care of the children along with the teachers. She truly loves and takes care of every child that walks through the door. With a leader like that I can tell you that the whole school is the same way. They were amazing at communication and educating me along the way so I could be apart of my daughter journey.

My daughter has a gluten sensitivity and they have been very helpful in supporting this. I also appreciate that all children must bring vegetables or fresh fruit as snacks and once per month the children have a Montessori Meal and a fun storytelling & pizza day. I highly recommend any family to explore if Montessori is a fit for their child, and recommend this campus as the place to do it!",

        "text": "My eight year old attended Brightpath in Crescent Heights for several years as a toddler. So when looking for childcare for our daughter, Brightpath was a great place to start and the Springbank location was close to us. However we’ve had several concerning situations and actually withdrew our daughter from care there recently. The biggest concern is that our daughter broke her hand at the facility. Her hand is swollen, black and blue and now has a splint and XRay showing a break. The daycare is saying they have no idea at all what happened and everything was fine when she was there. It was very obvious when we picked her up she was in pain and she was very clearly telling us she hurt her hand. She can also show us exactly how it happened. The daycare refuses to write up any type of report as there is no evidence it happened at daycare - other than the child actually stating it did?! We removed her immediately. Our other concerns began about 6 months ago when she was moved at 2 into the 3-5 year old room and they don’t let children nap in that room. This seemed crazy and we went for weeks asking them to accommodate her napping. They would just say she’s not tired and they asked her to sleep in the chair in the room. It just seemed so ridiculous. I don’t recommend this Brightpath.",

The toddler program has had a noticeable impact on my youngest's concentration and behaviour - he will still be rambunctious, but at least he asks for permission before he makes a mess.  That said, being a skeptic of Montessori type environments I am now a convert to the style of learning.  It's not for every child, or parent for that matter, but it worked wonders for our children.  I really think it is the teachers that make a school, and the teachers here are outstanding.\n\nWe have since left the school (career reasons) and our children are well-prepared from their time at MCHA. More importantly, throughout the whole COVID-19 scenario we were apprized of the situation and when things opened up (w/ AHS restrictions) we reenrolled our youngest and to the best of their abilities Campus 1 and the wonderful/loving teachers were able to provide our son an island of joy and consistency in a world of turmoil and uncertainty.  We owe the wonderful folks at Campus 1 for doing such an incredible job in a very difficult time.\n\nThings were done right and we always knew our children were taken care of, always.",

        "text": "I have waited the better part of half a decade to write this review. Our son enrolled in MCHA as soon as he was able, and tomorrow will be his last day. This is what we can tell you about this place.\n\nFirst, the head directress is CRAZY. She is absolutely bonkers about child development and squeezing every ounce of performance out of your child. She has a knack for hiring knowledgeable and caring staff, and has created a very nurturing environment for children.\n\nIn the early years, they helped greatly in potty training our child. They provided a great structure daily which I believe set a great tone for our child.\n\nLater on, that structure translated to good habits. As the education continued, our child was challenged to do his best at every turn. He started kindergarten miles ahead of his classmates, which I accredit to MCHA. he was well adjusted to a classroom environment, made friends easily, and did not struggle at all with classroom style education.\n\nThey have many family events throughout the year, and in this way, helped our son form everlasting bonds with friends. Even we as parents have met friends! Examples include: grandparents tea, daddy day, mommy day, winter carnivals, year end galas, summer picnics, etc. These events really helped to create a feeling of family, and speaking to other friends who chose other childcare options, is super rare in the industry.\n\nWe went through COVID together. While COVID made everything crazy, killed businesses, and wreaked havoc, MCHA stayed an open, and implemented great policies. Of course, at the time I didn’t think this way , and disagreed and even argued with them. In hindsight, I can recognize where I might have had the wrong idea, and while they are a business, I truly believe they made decisions based firstly on the wellbeing of the children, with profit second or third in mind.\n\nChoosing MCHA was one of the best choices I have made for my son so far. If they ever open I private school, I would be all in!\n\nThey really are that good, and we will miss them as our son grows past this stage of his life.",

We love the curriculum and appreciate the nature walks, and outdoor classroom in the summer. Our son surprises every day with the new things he comes home with.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone seeking a pre-school!",

        "text": "My kiddo was at another daycare run by this company.  My child showed signs of trauma from being in their \"care\" for which we had to take her for testing, and two years on as a family we are Still experiencing the reprecussions and fall out of the confirmed trauma.  When I raised the issue with the owner I was contacted by someone out of this daycare who, although empathetic to my experience, was unable to get the owner to resolve the issue.  I took my concerns and anger from licensing all the way to my MLA at the time and the AB Justice Minister.  Turns out (because of legislation) licensing can't have a daycare shut down in Alberta as long as the daycare says they'll keep working on trying to do better.  Mount Royal Daycare has since been closed, is my understanding, although not sure the exact why.  In connecting with parents that also had their kids in the care of this company I have found my story and experience is not unique.  The staff will turn over and often are great with the kids (some are not).  Their hands, however, are tied by the behaviour and policies set out by the owners.  The website is beautiful and has really positive, buzworthy words.  If it hadn't been for my own family's horrific experience with this company and finding it was not unique or isolated, I would have thought this was a great place for my kiddo.  In summary, it was not safe and my trust was misplaced in them.",

The staff is very friendly and truly care for the children.  Paula, the daycare manager is very approachable and has a good understanding of how all the kids are doing.  There is a good combination of play variance, free play, strucuted play, arts & crafts, and physical activity.  They have also started a french program, and have learned sign language as well.  My only complaint is that I wish there was more email communication about staff changes and monthly meal plans, but with that said they do post all of that information in the daycare, so its really more of a suggestion than a complaint.\nThis daycare embraces all cultures, and multi-language families, which is something we really love.\nAnytime there has been a notable injury, we have been notified via a formal form the staff fills out outlining the series of events, but nothing major has ever happened.  The kids get in scuffles all the time, but nothing more than normal kid stuff.\nOverall, we are very happy with this childcare centre and would recommend it!",

There is plenty of outdoor space and the setup feels like a home away from home. After moving our kids from another daycare, they were more settled in here in a few days than they were after a few months at the previous place. When we pick them up at the end of the day their teachers have so many updates and you can really tell they genuinely care about our little ones. The class sizes are nice and small, and the activities are open-ended and fun. Our 3 year old comes home so excited to tell us all about her day, and our 1 year old settles into the arms of her teachers just like she does with mom and dad at home. What a relief it is to find a daycare like this for the most important little people in our lives.",

We liked the smaller size of this daycare compared to other ones in the area as it feels cozy like a day home with the service of a proper center. The staff have been wonderful in both nurturing and teaching our child things we as parents couldnt possibly think of. The staff are both professional and reliable which are qualities you search for when making the decision to leave your child in someone elses care. The center is very clean and tidy which is a miracle because my human is a single handed personal tornado and there are oodles of children being children in there! The owner Janet and director Andrea are very responsive to the needs of parents and are in regular communication with families about center updates. The staff are absolutely passionate about caring for children and it's such a relief to see your child run into the class each day with a quick \"bye mommy\" vs the dreaded cling and cry (which by the way are also handled so well by the teachers...makes for less tears for us parents too!)\nHands down come take a look at NBCC. We love it there.",

I agreed with one of the parents who left a review 4 years ago and said\" They were unwilling to address concerns and flat out ignore emails if it was not positive\". The owner does not care if you email your concerns to her. You will never see her btw. The whole place is run by the director (who is actually another staff with a title but no power). If you have a complaint, it will go nowhere. I think management is a huge issue in this place. The care taker are hit and missed. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. One has so much attitude towards parents. They prefer taking their time to write down your kid's arrival time to opening the door to you while it is a snow storm outside. My kid was there for 6 months, we saw more than 7 different staff there.\n-They also take 1st month child care fee and the last month fee right off the bet ($1545 +1545 =$3090)\n-They need you to give two months notice if you wanted to switch day care (once you are in, you are stuck forever!!!)\n-Their building is old and falling apart (it was so hot this summer, 25 to 29 degrees and above; one teacher/care taker told me the A/C is not working properly)\n-The whole place has no structure; staff is not trained and just put there to work.\n-With the government subsidies, they have a 3% cap to increase price yearly (so they will increase that probably every year as they already did and explained this year, the increment is to cover their loss during the pandemic)\nI think this place take expensive fees and not delivering the standard and services that it should be. There are lots of child care centers out there that take the same price and give a much better service!!!",

        "text": "Two years ago, we moved to Calgary. There were too much to say. We send out little one to a family daycare at beginning. It turns out to be a disaster. We then have to hire a nanny to take care him until he was 3 years old. Then we send him to a daycare which doesn't provide lunch, and the two childcare givers need to care kids from age 3 to 5. It turns out they do not care about kids that much, it is just a job. We then moved our kids to panda daycare. My little one was 3 and half at that time. We were so happy to have him there. The teachers are really care for the kids. We mentioned our little one's weight is out of chart, hope they can give him more time to eat. They were very happy to help, and provide good solution to let him eat longer. We had mentioned the same problem to other daycare, their response is that they need take care so many kids, not just our little one! Other good part about this daycare is that they provide a lot great programs for kids. Music teacher comes 3 times a week, kids fitness lesson once per week with a small fee, a lot of field trips, many interesting things to do, such as baking, art craft etc. The most important thing is that the teachers are very nice, considerable and negotiable!! Plus this daycare provide breakfast, lunch and snack. It saved me a lot of time.  We definitely love Panda.",

I was told that they were unable to reach Darrel, as he was on vacation, and that no tour would be provided. This was completely unprofessional conduct. If they were not providing tours due to the outbreak, they should have contacted any viewings to inform us prior to arrival for two reasons: 1. I would not have attended a facility with a GI outbreak to protect my daughter from potentially getting ill as a result of my attending the facility and 2. Wasting our time to turn us away at the door was very poor business. This should have been done in advance. Thankfully, this has certainly narrowed down our search options, as we will never send our daughter to such a facility.",

The director is AMAZING and although my kids miss her in class they still feel like they see her and get to interact with her! She ALWAYS makes time to listen to any concern I may have about my kids and goes out of her way to help me. I’ve seen her do this with other parents also! Sure truly has the kids in her heart and wants what’s best For them! My kids couldn’t love going to “school” any more then they do and after the weekend are so very thrilled to see their teachers again! Thank you so much to ALL of the staff at this location for helping a mama to know that my kids are loved and cared for while not in my care you all are rockstars!

My wife and I looked at several day cares before visiting Panda, and I immediately got a great vibe when we walked in Panda’s door. That vibe was more than fulfilled. You can see it in everything that transpires at Panda - the staff, from the director to the teachers to the kitchen staff, all love children. I will fully admit I approached the whole concept of daycare with trepidation, but any doubts I had were completely erased by this wonderful place.\n\nThe way my daughter’s face lights up when she sees her teachers is so heartwarming. The HiMama app the staff use shows what your child is doing throughout the day, and I would definitely say they are having a blast. They sing songs, play with an incredible variety of toys, get plenty of outdoor time when the weather permits, and just generally have fun. The kitchen staff always have a delicious and healthy variety of meals and snacks to serve, even for picky children. My daughter typically naps very well, because the staff do such an amazing job making sure they have a good time!\n\nAgain, I cannot emphasize enough the warmth, dedication and compassion I see from all the staff there, and they do it every day, eight hours a day, five days a week. They’re so accommodating. My daughter benefits from Panda so significantly, and I feel truly fortunate she is looked after by such lovely people.",

Our older daughter has been there for 3.5 years and our younger one just started a few months ago.\nI am so impressed and grateful everyday for this daycare and the staff that make it the exceptional place that it is for the kids. I feel so good about dropping them off there everyday and have no worries or anxiety about the care they are receiving because I know it is excellent. The staff are so caring, patient and loving, always have the best interest of the kids in mind and welcome them in the mornings with open arms and big smiles. Both my kids love going there and are always excited about it. They both absolutely love their teachers, which to me means they are treated very well. Any of my concerns regarding the kids are always taken seriously by the director and the teachers. We get many updates and pictures/videos throughout the day regarding how and what the kids are doing and even details like their mood and how long they napped.\nBefore we decided on a daycare, we looked at A LOT of different ones and there was always something about each one that I did not feel right about. But after viewing Panda I felt so good and excited about it because there was not even one thing that made me concerned or uncomfortable. I still feel this way 3.5 years later. It is clean, it is safe, it is fun, it is a loving environment, staff genuinely care, and staff are highly educated and knowledgeable in childcare. My kids learn so much and have a lot of fun because the teachers plan the activities and learning around what they see are the children's interests.\nI also really love how they make it a priority to take the kids outside to play once or twice a day (weather depending of course), because we think getting outside is so beneficial. The outdoor play areas are very nice, safe and age appropriate. The food they serve the kids is exciting to them while still being healthy and including all food groups.\nThere are just so many great things I could say about the Ranchlands Panda Daycare and I have no complaints. We are so appreciative to all the great staff and all their hard work and care every single day. Thank you a million times to them!",

As an example of Panda staff going above and beyond for our daughter: we usually hold her until she falls asleep, and the staff here held her for all her naps (although she needs this less, now!)\n\nOur daughter also has difficulty transitioning away from being home every day, and was often only happy when being held. So the staff at Panda held her almost all day.\n\nNow, our daughter is thriving. She rarely needs to be held during the day or during naps, and last week, she didn't even watch me leave as she was so interested in what was going on in the room.\n\nThe staff here are amazing. We have confidence leaving our daughter in their capable care.\n\n*Update: after a full year, we continue to be blown away by the great care our daughter receives from the staff here. I recommend Panda to anyone, without reservation. Your child will be well cared for here.\n\nUpdate 2: another year later, and we still have no complaints. Baby #2 is also here, now. Great, clean space. Great programming. And most importantly, staff we have confidence trusting our children with.",

The camp was led by Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan, whose dedication to education and attention to detail truly set the tone for an exceptional learning environment.\n\nFrom the very beginning, it was evident that Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan were not just instructors, but passionate educators who genuinely cared about each child's growth and development. Their enthusiasm for education was contagious, making every class engaging and exciting for both myself and my child.\n\nOne of the remarkable aspects of the camp was the attention to detail in designing each class. The curriculum was thoughtfully structured to balance learning and enjoyment, ensuring that the children not only had fun but also gained valuable knowledge in every session. This approach created a perfect blend of entertainment and education that kept both kids and parents excited about each day of the camp.\n\nWhat truly made the experience special was the personal touch that Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan brought to their interactions with the children. Their ability to connect with each student on an individual level fostered a positive and encouraging atmosphere. This personalized approach helped my child feel valued and motivated to actively participate and learn.\n\nThe only minor area that could use some improvement was the cleanliness of the school floor. I noticed that on a daily basis, when my child returned home, his socks were quite dirty and covered in dust. Perhaps a bit more attention to maintaining the cleanliness of the floors could enhance the overall experience, ensuring that the learning environment remains as exceptional as the educational content.\n\nOverall, the summer camp at Renert School was a truly outstanding experience. Mrs. Angela and Mr. Ryan's dedication to education, attention to detail, and genuine enthusiasm created an environment where learning was not only enjoyable but also deeply rewarding. Both myself and my child left the camp with a sense of accomplishment and a desire to continue exploring new horizons in education. I would wholeheartedly recommend Renert School's programs to anyone seeking a meaningful and enriching educational experience for their children.",

        "text": "I'm currently a student at this school, and I love it! I just want to share my experience with those considering attending this school. However, since I am in junior high, I can't attest to other grades.\n\nTL;DR: The teachers are knowledgeable, and the school considers each student's abilities and puts them into certain classes that allow them to move at their own pace. The school also provides students with the freedom to choose some of their courses. However, there should be more communication between the administration and students, and there is a lot of homework.\nQuality of education: 10/10\nTeachers: 9/10\nSocial life: 7/10\nQuality of location: 10/10\n\nMost teachers, as not everyone can be perfect, are awesome and teach well, and are very knowledgeable in their area. I am excited to learn something new every time I go to class, and have had several in depth conversations with teachers. I also need to mention that in subjects like math and English, students are put in certain classes by their level of understanding, allowing students to move at their own pace. This has allowed me to move forward, and I am glad that the school takes each student's needs into consideration.\n\nI love the choice this school provides, with \"electives\" and \"Choice Friday\". Electives are like mini courses that different teachers offer, and students get to choose which ones they go to. While Choice Friday is when the entire Friday is filled with classes of the students' choice. These courses have allowed me to discover my interests, and it gives something to look forward to everyday. The school also provides a variety of clubs to join.\n\nNow, I want to talk a bit about the social life. The school does set up some events for students to hang out, such as school dances. Also, many students opt to spend time together in the cafeteria after classes end, so there is an active social life.\n\nHowever, I will now mention some negatives to give a weighted review. I think that there needs to be more communication between the administration and students, so students can provide feedback to the school. Also, keep in mind, especially if you are in junior high or high school, there will be a lot of homework that you will need to juggle. I know that I struggle with managing my time to get everything done.",

Speaking from experience, this really helps to make learning fun and more personal than any other school I’ve been to. Class sizes are small which allows each student to connect with their teachers in ways that other larger schools don’t allow. Their motto of “Serious Fun” could not be more accurate to the design of the school. The school helps each and every student achieve success in a matter that is both engaging and fun. Renert is a dream school that has helped me and many other students in so many ways. I am incredibly grateful for all the staff at Renert for all they do and I cannot recommend this school enough.",

Shortly after, she harshly grabbed two other boys in an aggressive way because they were just playing in the clothing racks at the front.

I had started the hunt for the right day care early on as we had a cow milk protein allergy and wanted to find a place we were felt comfortable and confident it wouldn't be overlooked. We toured many in the central NW/NE area and after meeting with Janelle, they were the obvious choice. The owner operator has children herself that attend the daycare so we felt that the standards must be upheld to a strong degree. The teachers rotate among the classes so even though we don't get to become as familiar with a select few, they are all very friendly. Communication is through the common himama app, which is easy to use and we have been happy with the response rate. We get lots of photo updates throughout the day, a mood update and the daily report at the end of the day. Jess, the program director, is approachable and friendly. As new parents we had tons of questions and concerns in the first few months and Jess has always been informative and accommodating! The parking lot is a bit weird to get out of, especially during busy times. As long as you have a back up camera, it's all good! The location next to a bottle Depot and in an industrial area may be off-putting for some, but I recommend to take a tour with Janelle first before passing them over  We chose them over the big name franchise daycares and we are happy with our choice.",

I WANNA SAY EVERY BAD REVIEW IS SAYING “ SCAM AND NOT OUR CLIENT “” but I can name all the staff members including the director so I hope they don’t say that in this review. I sent my daughter to this daycare as we had not many choices as we recently moved to the area and upon registration I verified if there are going to be daily reports of how kids do and how their day was which is a normal process of a daycare !! They made me download their app as well When I didn’t get any report for few days nothing at all as a parent and joining new daycare I asked them how I am not getting any reports and I got reply back that I should be getting it and when I asked few times about daily reports as I was expecting it itself and one day my daughter mentioned it how one of the teacher was bit rude to her and she didn’t want to go to school so I called and spoke to the staff but they said nothing happened like that at all and then few days later director called me when I went to pick up my daughter. She said my daughter lies in her class  no one want to be friends with her and if she continues then she will become a bully ????? Like she was talking about a 4 years old child ??? What kind of director or daycare is that ? And then I was told that why I am keep asking for daily reports as they feel that I DON’T  TRUST THEM ?? AS a matter of fact your own staff promised me something and later on to cover your mistakes they started pointing fingers at us and my child ( keeping in mind , my child is only 4 years old ) and I was told by the director that  after 3 years old they treat the child as an Adult ??? Wow I was really shocked with all these statements. I was told if I don’t trust them I can terminate the same day ? Like I need to find new place as a working parent. I felt completely lost with what was it all about and next day they day when I went to pick her up director said my daughter was really good today ? Like how. I didn’t say anything to her and why would I  !! I would never recommend this school to anyone. Whenever I went to pick up my child   Kids every time would keep hugging her and embrace my daughter with love.  It was completely lie that how I was told that children do not like to play with her. Director was the one of the rudest individuals I met and her comments were completely unprofessional, she said which daycare does daily reports ? I immediately started looking for new school and found it. Had to quit in couple months. Would never recommend this place.",

        "text": "We did a mistake by not checking the reviews for this day care before sending our child there. Our kid was diagnosed with ASD last year and this daycare collaborates with PUFF to provide care for ASD diagnosed kids. Apparently that’s only for show! Our kid was always hungry there inspite of the fact that we used to send food for her everyday. Daycare was adamant about sending child in the morning before 8 and then if you come to pick her up around 1-2 they had problem stating that it’s the time when kids are sleeping. When we used to pick her around 3, she used to be really tired, sleepy and cranky (for obvious reason because she was hungry). If we tried to drop child at around 12, then their head Gazala would come off really rude stating ‘we are not going to accept child at this hour’!!! It’s a daycare, not school. You don’t feed our child so it’s difficult for us to leave our child for 6-8 hours there without food! Parents drop kids at daycare according to the convenient times based on their jobs. We still adjusted with them since we needed daycare for her. And teachers were not even compassionate with kids. And in mid February one day when my husband was picking up our daughter, Gazala came in to state ‘we are not going to accept your child from march!’ On asking why, said said “she has meltdowns, she is difficult to look after that’s why”. When I went in to talk to her she said “I have to put in another person to look after her which costs me one extra person’s salary so I cannot have your child!” Are you kidding me!!!! When talking to PUFF coordinator she confirmed there was no change in meltdowns or aggression in our child. Confronting Gazala with the same she stated “I don’t know why she said that but we can’t have her” I asked “why do you collaborate with PUFF, there is no point. Why force us to leave her at 8? How you can tell us not to send her after 2 weeks without giving us enough notice to find a place good enough for her? “ Absolutely no answer except “we can’t have her, I can’t pay another person to look after her”!!! You can’t be serious! Why even bother to have a daycare when you can’t support child, when you or the teachers don’t feel compassion for kids, why even be in this profession. My child’s care is just a business profit for you that you are stating it will cost her more! Absolutely ridiculous behaviour, no parent should ever be sending their child to this horrible place!",

        "text": "Our daughter has been with Seedlings for the last two years. I highly recommend this school to anyone interested in the Spanish language (or really anyone looking for caring, responsive care for their children).\n\nWe’ve found the teachers to be kind, nurturing, thoughtful, and very capable. The staff-to-student ratios are ideal for small group learning and ensuring our daughter gets plenty of one-on-one attention. We appreciate the art portfolios and progress reports that the school provides. We also love the HiMama app. It simplifies communication with the school and teacher, and we love the daily photos and videos. Thanks to Miss Yenni, Miss Imi, Miss Sonia, Miss Gina, and all of the other wonderful teachers and staff!\n\nSeedlings sounds like a great school and program, but we were ultimately drawn to them after visiting the school in person. The classroom is carefully laid out so everything is accessible and welcoming to young children. It's warm, inviting, and full of the children's projects from throughout the year. It felt like the kind of place we would want to be ourselves, if we were children.\n\nSeedlings is Reggio-based, but aspects of Montessori that we were drawn to: a child-led approach, carefully prepared environment, the teacher as a guide, and mixed-age classrooms, were better represented in Seedlings than in any other school we visited.\n\nWhile neither parent speaks Spanish, our daughter comes home singing Spanish songs and surprising us with her comprehension of Spanish children’s books we pick up at the library. It’s clear that the way Spanish-learning is facilitated here is immersive, fun, and memorable for her.\n\nThe variety of activities and creative work the students do on a daily basis is fantastic. The children get plenty of outdoor time, with a variety of nearby options for outings (and a large, indoor gym space for smoky days). Our kiddo particularly loves yoga and water fun days. The teachers have also done a wonderful job putting together the children's end-of-year and Christmas concerts. We're so grateful to have found Seedlings!",

My two kids (age 4 and 2) are attending the bilingual program at the Downtown - Scarboro location, and I couldn't be happier with our choice.\n\nWhy do I recommend this daycare:\n1. Outstanding teachers - supportive, enthusiastic and genuinely caring teachers make this daycare a real gem.\n2. Excellent curriculum - daily Spanish, music, art and science (experiments) classes. They also have a big gym space, which is particularly useful for physical activities during our long winters.\n3. Small group sizes - lots of one-on-one time helps create a stronger bond between teachers and children, making the children feel safe. It also helps to develop friendships.\n4. Mixed-age groups - one of the reasons I initially decided on this daycare. I wanted my children to participate in the same program and grow together. They will have continuity of care and go through fewer transitions from caregiver to caregiver. I've noticed older children being very nurturing toward my younger child, and she learns a lot from her older peers. They support each other.\n\nMy kids truly love their teachers. Thank you, Miss April and Miss Gina, and other teachers at the Scarboro location, for taking such wonderful care of my kids!",

She has also cultivated an affinity for crafting that clearly has been fostered in this amazing program.

        "text": "Not impressive at all!  A person would walk in and love what they see.  A Good Earth to the right promises caffeine while you wait in line, a large library just past that promising more dreams to be discovered. The bird's nest dropping from the ceiling above you while the cranes fly towards it.  It looks so magical.\n\nThen you get to the counter to pay for your way in.  It's $18.50 and it takes at least 10 minutes to get you in.  They have to know everything about you and not just what you want to go do there.  It's a recreation center, not a police department!   So after finally getting in, I go to the locker rooms, and discover that the lockers are not secure.  You have to provide your own lock.  You can get one there but you have to spend and extra $20 for it. You end up taking your valuables with you to the pool.\n\nTheir waterpark seems okay.  Sadly, the waterslides were apparently closed and you had to wait for a hour before a person can get to enjoy them.  But that's okay because that flowrider is calling your name.  It is an indoor surf-pool that you get to ride on and it is not a gentle ride either.  Quite frankly, it kicks you around like an old hacky sack.  It really is thrilling and fun.  Worth the thirty minute wait.  That is the first star.\n\nHowever, you have to sign a waiver that isn't there and was not mentioned to you when you paid the fee.  However, one saving grace is this wonderful lifeguard named Ella who actually helped you fill one out on your phone and still watches you valuables for you while to try this place out.  She is the only reason why this place is getting a second star.\n\nThe rest is not good.  When questions were asked to other lifeguards and they did not know the answers to anything.  Not so great!  The lazy pool was clearly made by lazy people.  It looks so small and uninspired.  All you do is walk in a flowing circle.  The hot tubs were tepid at best.  You can feel yourself shivering still.  The sauna was alright but the air feels the same as the pool, choleric and not altogether pleasant.  Lastly, everything was closed.  Diving boards, waterslides (that did not open an hour later), and who knows what else were not open.\n\nThere needs to be some serious changes and not just to these odd schedules but the customer service is atrocious.  Customers are not made aware of any waivers, the staff does not know what is going on with their equipment or environment, and on top of that, not too many people were that friendly or approachable.  Please do better with this and take a few notes from Ella who was actually the one helpful person.\n\nFor $18.50 you can make this a place where everyone feels welcome, has fun, and everything is in working order.  Some of us have spent less money to go into a pool/waterpark and have had some great times.  Please do better!",

They are professional, committed to adhering to the many policies and procedures required for accreditation, but most of all, they are so loving to our boys!\n\nWhen my sensitive eldest son was struggling with the change in transitioning from the Baby room to the Toddler room, every teacher in the Centre was rooting for his success and helped to make the transition as easy as possible.  Even those teachers not involved with the rooms in question would let us know \"he's doing so much better\" and \"he's doing great\".  It made such a difference for us to know that everyone was on his side and watching out for him.  With the care and encouragement of the preschool teachers, he has blossomed from a shy boy who would not participate in organized activities/arts & crafts to an outgoing participant in all things - I give them so much credit for this transition.\n\nThe staff genuinely care about the kids in the Centre - they get to know each child's little personality quirks, interests and skills and enjoy drawing them out and celebrating them.  They also understand each child's individual challenges and help to support them through these.\n\nWhen we drop our children off each day, I am confident they are in a safe, caring environment where they will be supported, loved and have lots of fun - there is always something new going on!",

Loved the waterslide, and wave pool.  Also a nice deep hot tub which is a good size.  The only things I would suggest is spending more time cleaning the outside.

I went straight to the gym and my husband went with our daughter. He dropped her off and I remained in the building while he left. After 5'-10' I received a call, a voice that was asking me where am I exactly 'cause she has to come to \"check on me\". I could not believe it, say what? You have no authority, what checking means to you?! She is my child and I know what responsibility means. If I bring her couple of times per week that doesn't mean  I need someone to come and check me, it means that you have a job and I get to go to the gym, end of story. It's unbelievable, I don't know who hired these people but I won't accept that kind of behaviour, never! Long story short we took our daughter out and that was it.

I was given a one week free pass and then two additional day passes to cover the gap for my 65th birthday in a few days.  I'll be joining as a full 'senior' member on my birthday.  I look forward to signing up for the deep water exercise program.  The swimming lanes and competition hot pool are fantastic!!!!",

The facility exceeded all my expectations, and it's easily one of the best aquatic centers I've ever visited.\n\nThe pool area was clean, spacious, and well-maintained, creating a welcoming environment for visitors of all ages. The water temperature was just right, making it comfortable for swimming, splashing, and playing around. The variety of pools catered to different preferences, from the fun-filled leisure pool with water features to the lap pool for serious swimmers.\n\nThe water slides were a highlight of the experience! It felt like a mini water park with thrilling slides that both kids and adults enjoyed. The lifeguards were attentive and made sure everyone followed safety guidelines, which added to the overall peace of mind.\n\nI appreciated the ample seating and lounging areas around the pool, providing a perfect spot to relax and soak up some sun between swims. The entire facility had a friendly and family-oriented atmosphere, making it a great place for a day of fun with loved ones.\n\nAdditionally, the changing rooms and amenities were clean and well-equipped, making it easy to freshen up after a swim.\n\nOverall, Shane Homes YMCA at Rocky Ridge's swimming pool is a top-notch aquatic destination in Calgary. Whether you're a water enthusiast or just looking for a fun day out, I highly recommend this place for an enjoyable and refreshing experience.",

There are grown men going into the universal washroom where it’s meant for you and your family to go and change but there’s grown men whose lockers are beside young children and that are changing there. There are no doors separating the washrooms between the men, women, and universal changing rooms there is just one big door that is open for everyone to see. The pool itself is very unsanitary and there are loads of chlorine that are unsafe and health risking for those who have serious health problems and including pregnant women. The drains were full of hair, dirt and skin! The hot tub was cloudy and brown. The lack of cleanliness is leading to the drains to become clogged and build a great amount of dirt and debris which could cause many people to become extremely sick. I would not recommend this place to take your kids to swim. The gym itself is nice but is it really clean?!?",

My kids were exposed to many different experiences, activities, and field trips (both in school and off site). They had many opportunities to walk to the ravine near the school and learn from nature. The classroom built on many of the foundational skills necessary to prepare them for kindergarten based on each child’s readiness level in a pressure free environment. I also had lots of opportunities to volunteer in the classroom. Both my kids absolutely loved the teachers and their first experience and exposure to a school setting.

Multiple activities, such as pysanka decoration, baking, field trips were planned throughout the year. St Nicholas Concert, Mother’s Day Tea and Family Fun Night were some of the annual events that both children and parents looked forward to.\nSadochok truly helped my son successfully prepare for kindergarten, as well as learn the Ukrainian language, culture and traditions.

My daughter began to talk better, eat better and overall her development progressed a lot since we started going Sadochok. I love that every day my daughter brings some crafts (unique each time). They have a piano teacher who plays music every day. Kids love music and they are taught how to sing in both English and Ukrainian.\n\nMy daughter is a poor eater, she doesn't want to eat at home, but she always eats at Sadocohok. Teachers feed them. Kids play outside every day. The place is very clean, no issues at all.\n\nI would never trust anyone else to take care of my daughter. I'm confident that she is in great hands and she is safe. Thank you, Sadochok, for being a great place for every child. My daughter loves your childcare, and I don't think there is a better recognition than when my daughter wakes up every day and wants to go to Sadochok. HUGE THANK YOU!",

Sadochok encourages learning with daily routines and activities ranging from puzzles, to early math and reading / writing skills and even baking / cooking for special events.\nSadochok has an ability to embrace learning through play and allows kids to develop independence, pride and ability to tackle any task.  Teachers have phenomenal style that our son truly benefited from, we are more than sure that all of the kids did. It was very easy for us to notice what an amazing learning environment Sadochok has created for all the kids. Sadochok provides a safe environment for children to explore their work and socialize with other kids, but also provides an age appropriate curriculum for the preschool aged children. The techniques are extremely effective, yet firm manner, produces amazing results with the kids. It was easy to notice, that our son was performing tasks way beyond what his friends of the same age were doing at other daycare facilities and it was the key for him to successfully transition into public kindergarten. Sadochok not only teaches kids the skills necessary to perform, but it provides kids with the confidence and discipline to achieve success.  We truly believe that if we had more preschools similar to Sadochok, our children would be better prepared for school and have a better start and more success in our education system.\nThank you Sadochok for the hard work and unique style of teaching kids how to start their life adventure!  Truly wish every family has the same opportunity as we had!\n\nKind regards,\nIryna and Kevin G.",

I will try to be objective as much as possible.\nThe facility where the daycare is located is rented out for social functions such as weddings and parties over the weekends or in summer time. After all, you do not have to go any further than to read some of the comments from individuals who rented the premises.\n\nThe daycare itself is located at the church basement with little or no daylight.\n\nIn the late fall of 2016 when I came to bring my child I saw daycare workers cleaning up the mess that was left by renters who rented the premises over the weekend!  The hall was rented by Bulgarian community  members tho just had too much alcohol and were unable to control themselves.  I have nothing against Bulgarian community at all, but I am just basing my statement on what the daycare workers said to me.\n\nAs I discovered that day,  my daughters' shoes were missing and were nowhere to be found. Her clothing was all over the place. In addition there was broken furniture that the daycare workers were trying to fix. The place was dirty. The janitor The  daycare workers were trying to do the damage control by saying that there was nothing wrong and that the problems will be taken care of.\nThe next day the premises were cleaned up and looked OK, however I have a problem having children staying in the bar or place where alcohol is consumed and who knows what kind of drunks who may be carrying all sorts of diseases attended.\nMy older daughter was infected with wart and we still have problem having it cured to this day.\nLastly, I also saw that the daycare workers were working while having flu and were very sick. On a few occasions there were only a a few children at the daycare as many of them were became infected with flu.\n\nIn 2016 this daycare had problems attracting new children to attend. The quality of education is not bad, but what is the point of having educated but sick children?\n\nThese are the things that I personally witnessed. I want the facts to speak for themselves.\nI would like to have the reader to arrive with his/her own conclusions.",

During the year and a half that we were there, lots of staff moved around, and/or left the organization. They went through five managers during the time we were there and often we were given conflicting information from one to the next. Once my son started exhibiting signs of emotional dysregulation related to his ADHD, we had 1 in person meeting, he was suspended 2 weeks later (he was part-time and had only attended 3 days within that two week period). He was 4 years old and we were told he couldn't come back until he had an aide for one-on-one care. I wasn't able to hire someone myself, they would not hire without funding, and told me it was too difficult for them to hire someone at that time. I was able to get some emergency support through Providence and they worked with Summit to determine a re-entry plan that was only a few hours a couple times a week. A few days before he was to restart, they emailed me to say they changed their mind. I wrote to complain and asked for the CEO Nancy Klensch to call me, but she never bothered (or was never told?). So not a great place for neurodiverse kids unless you already have funding in place for additional help.",

        "text": "We are happy to put Sunvalley behind us and put our child in school where there is consistency, with the teachers not changing every month and receiving proper communication from the staff.  Our experience with this centre started out great in 2021 but once the director in 2021 left and all the good teachers were forced out, it declined rapidly and continues to do so.  Coming to pick my child up and seeing the daily chaos in the classroom that was so dysfunctional was hard to witness.  We had several incidents with other children and was told that a solution would be forthcoming of a quiet space for kids to go to calm down when they needed a time out and as soon as it was implemented in the form of a tent it was removed and put elsewhere as the children used it as a hang out.  No other solution was ever put forward or communicated.  I also worried for the safety of the children as the front door hasn't locked let alone closed properly for the last month or more of our time there and no one seemed to have any urgency to fix it.  I mentioned it several times to staff and the director without much concern or action from anyone.  My child was napped until 4 1/2 years old despite my CONSTANT pleading with the director and the staff to stop as I (along with many other parents) stating that my child hasn't napped since 3 years old like most children and was told constantly it was for her benefit and that she wanted too.  Of course she wanted too she was being told too...! This caused much regression at home and made bedtime a struggle most nights.  I communicated our frustrations and wishes to the director who always compared her younger child to mine and said \"well my child still naps and sometimes they just need it\".  I got no where.\nThey rarely did any crafts which is very sad for a pre-kindergarten program and when you are paying the annual material fee it is very disappointing.  All that would be ever sent home is a small scrap piece of paper with some colouring on it or a photocopied colouring picture that she had done sometimes 3-4 times already in the classroom. Needless to say my child was very bored with the lack of stimulation.  Before the decline in the centre's staff the previous teacher that was in the pre-school room (before she was forced to resign) did the most creative crafts with the kids almost everyday and was so in-tune with what was going on, and the kids were so excited to attend class each day.  She would send many pictures and updates on the app per day regarding your child and now you are lucky to get a single picture during the week and most of the time it is of another child.\nLastly, the one event that my child was looking forward too was pre-k graduation as she had participated in the previous year.  I asked the director and staff regularly at the end of May and into June if it was going to happen on the date specified on the centre's calendar (June 23) and was told repeatedly that they hadn't thought about it and was told it might happen on a Friday night or a Saturday in July but they didnt know. Nonetheless, we were emailed this Monday and told that it is scheduled for this Friday night and all families are being charged for the use of the gown.  This is so disheartening to know that we were given only 4 days notice and most families will not be given the opportunity to attend due to busy summer schedules and children that have already left the centre as noted previously.  Dispite reaching out to the director she never addressed my concerns or lack of notice and planning.\nIt is very upsetting when I look back that the centre is considered Montessori but don't adhere to most of the requirements with little to no structure.  I do not recommend this centre and didn't move my child simply because of the great friends we made.  Childcare is no joke and should be taken very seriously.  We are entrusting you with our children and you should be ensuring their growth, development and most importantly safety each and everyday.  Which they have failed to do. They have alot of work to do.",

The daycare price here is quite cheaper compared to the previous one and after few visits of this centre, we were convinced to give a shot. So far, we are happy of this move. The transition was super smooth and it's like nothing really changed in his life. The team there takes good care of our boy and one of the best part is that we receive several pictures and/or videos on a daily basis through the app! That's great! The most important is that our boy seems happy over there (when you see him running towards the teachers after just a few weeks of attendance ... it's generally a good sign). Keep up the good work AND the reasonable price. Thanks.",

They are patient and passionate, and greet every child with a joy-full smile and a warm welcome.\n\nWhen asked to describe Child's Way, our daughters, years after, said they were, \"kind and generous\", \"nice to everybody\", and \"they love me and cared [about] me!\" ",

The staff is absolute top tier, even starting to teach her spanish when she said she wanted to learn it!    Also the food they serve the kids is literally the best I've seen in 16 years of having kids in daycare.    They were also gracious enough to adapt to my bonkers work schedule, which made my life way easier!     Their rates were very competitive, even being lower than other top tier centers.    They did have a bit of an issue when they switched to a new accounting system but it was handled quickly.

I can't express enough my gratitude towards every employee, teachers, chef and students. We are so thankful we've found this place and will recommend to all our friends and family. They are so caring and attentive the each kid's needs. It is simply beautiful to see. It is already so hard to let your kid go to daycare and I feel like everyone at the Learning Child Academy has made the process so much easier, put me and my husband at ease to send her to daycare knowing she was surrounded by such wonderful humans. THANK YOU!",

Coming from our previous childcare being a dayhome setting, I was nervous about the transition and the experience we would have at a larger centre, but I have been continually impressed by TLCMA.  The teachers care so much about the kids, and our children have developed a strong bond with many of the teachers and many of the other students.\n\nThis school is welcoming, clean, filled with  teachers who are simply happy and genuine people.  I have watched the programs grow, and they are building not only a strong school setting, but a sense of community for the families who attend here.\n\nThroughout the summer, there has been many really fun activities for the children, and we are looking forward to getting back into the regular curriculum and watching our little ones' minds grow.  Montessori has provided our children a great sense of independence and has helped us grow as parents as well.",

When we moved to Dover I was concerned about the new Daycare which is more affrodable than any other program I have ever heard of and does not use the Montessori model.\nMy daughter has been attending for more than two years now and has learned more and become better adjusted than any of the time she spent in her prior program. The children are always provided with activities that fit their interest and are not regelated to one paticular activity or subject, which sounds like it would be chaos, but it is the furthest thing from it! The teachers and leaders are adept at keeping the children engaged and participating with appropriate behaviour. The kids learn how to navigate relationships in an age appropriate manner while doing everything else.\nI LOVE Thornhill Dover and I hope my daughter gets to stay until she ages out.",

We have had outstanding experiences with the school so far. The staff are caring and nurturing, and it is a very comfortable environment to leave your child. One time I was there during pick-up and my daughter had a little trip and fall and she went to her teacher for a hug even though I was there (which is a good sign to me!). They provide a good balance of structured activities and free time, with lots of age-appropriate and stimulating learning experiences for the kids. All of the staff I have interacted with are great at communication and the school has done a good job to maintain safety as well as a sense of normalcy during the COVID pandemic. I've toured many different childcare centres, and the physical space at CELC is second to none.  Preschool and childcare classrooms resemble a kindergarten learning space and are very spacious for the number of children there. They also have access to a full gym, and great outdoor playground and field.  Despite having a late birthday and being the youngest in her kindergarten and grade 1 classes, my eldest daughter was well-prepared for school as a result of her time at CELC.

Good class size, organized, clean, safe. But mostly its the connection my kids have with their teachers. Singing songs they learned in school, taking about their science experiments. It has more than exceeded my expectations. We absolutely love everything about this school.",

We even reached out after my second maternity leave ended to see if she had space for our 2 children but she didn’t at that time or we would have ended up going with her full time. We would always run into AJ and her family in the community and at different community events and she would always stop to talk, see how we were all doing and talk to the kids. She kept in touch via text message to check in and loves to hear about how the children are doing. I am now a stay at home mom for the time being but if I did end up going back to work I would not hesitate to connect with AJ and see if she had space at her dayhome.",

They ask about how I soothe him at home, his favorite activities, foods, and much more. Most importantly, they take this information and implement it while caring for my kid.

They had access to programs that equipped my son with essential behavioral and speech skills, setting him up for a smooth kindergarten start.\n\nIt's always a concern for parents to leave their child at an institution, but every morning, my son's enthusiastic wave from the window and his eagerness to play put me at ease. There were even days he wished to stay a tad longer, fully immersed in play!\n\nThe enrichment offerings, including a Spanish class, are an outstanding complement to their regular curriculum. It's delightful to hear my five-year-old son randomly use Spanish words he's learned, showcasing the practical application of his lessons.\n\nI wholeheartedly endorse UEA. Their intimate group setting combined with devoted educators makes it a nurturing and enriching environment for any child.\n\nThank you to all the amazing staff at UEA!",

Being new parents can be very stressful and let alone the feeling of trusting your little one with someone else but teachers of UEA made it so much easier for us. Transition time at daycare could not have been smoother than what we experienced, all this happened due to exceptional service and understanding of Ms.Ilinka and her team. Ilinka is kind, passionate and most importantly understands little ones and parents. I have 3 kids go to daycare, She is always there welcoming our little one at front door with smile each morning. She is one reason our kids love that daycare.\nI appreciate diversity within staff members so our kids are learning alot of different things/cultures. Outdoor and indoor activities are great and best part they are always introducing something new. Our kids are learning alot more. Lastly, I want to thank Roxana, She is very open to feedback and quick to action.

Their staff are so good with the kids & even take the time to get to know us parents. In addition, their extended hours provide flexibility for those of us without family support networks around us.

I later found out that when he did not like the food provided, instead of  offering him something different, he was allowed to starve. The teachers and care givers know nothing about providing care and they are so impatient and very quick to label kids negatively.\n\nOne of the teachers told my son that occupations like engineering is not for girls because girls are weak. What a horrible thing to teach a child! Another teacher told him that he was different because he is black. My son was told so many horrible things and it took months to get those ideas out of his head.\n\nI will never encourage anyone with a preschooler to take their child here.",

        "text": "By far the worst daycare in the city. If you’re looking for a daycare that lies to you when they forget to pick your kid up from school or have the bus driver pick your child up in their personal vehicle and speed with them in the vehicle then by all means send your kids here! Not only did they forget to pick a kid up from school they lied about why they didn’t pick him up instead of apologizing that they forgot. This daycare smells absolutely terrible, I feel bad for the other kids that have to sit there all day. As for management Lisa she is always in a terrible mood and has an attitude, even the kids know it. I’ve even witnessed Lisa screaming at parents on multiple occasions in front of the daycare. They also do not follow court orders so if you’re worried about confidentiality I’d pick another daycare. A daycare is supposed to be trustworthy and honest and this place is very far from that! Don’t waste your money sending your kids here! Most unprofessional run daycare ever, the owner and manager will call you and cop and attitude even though they can’t seem to run things right on their end. Before you call customers and have an attitude maybe ask why a child is being pulled from your terrible daycare. This daycare seems to forget that they wouldn’t be making money or be open without PAYING customers. There is literally no positive about this daycare Stay far far away from this disaster!\n\nUPDATE: The owner of the daycare did not ask during the phone call why the child in question was being pulled from her daycare just wanted to give her attitude instead of asking why. Only after the fact that I posted this review did she reach out to apologize! Terrible business practices. Steer far away from this daycare!! So unprofessional, they continue to lie saying the child was not forgotten at school even though he was as per your daycare manager. The smell from your daycare has nothing to do with how many kids go there. You did not follow the court order as your daycare manager was in contact with someone on the court order that she shouldn’t have been in contact with. If it was important to you to resolve issues they would have been resolved when the incident happened not swept under the rug and forgotten about. Instead you send a text at 6am that childcare is suspended leaving us unable to go to work and give your customers attitude when you call. By far the most unprofessional place to send children. Had you resolved this properly prior to your ignorant phone call this review would not be necessary.",

        "text": "My child was in Webber for years, starting in the very early grade. But we chose to leave and go to a better school. This school looks perfect on the surface, just like what you see with your eyes, but inside, it's not.  If you have watched their winter concert, you can feel that they are trying to show everything perfectly, tightly and meticulously, but the children have no emotional involvement and they are not happy. I pick up my child every afternoon at the front door of main building, I see all children coming out from building, they are not in a healthy and happy mood most of the time.  This is probably the style of this school, requiring uniformity, but never let the children be themselves.  School teachers have changed a lot. They have always claimed that their teaching should be ahead of other schools, but their teachers do not have the ability to do so. They rank high in the exam because of the tutoring arranged by parents for their children after school.  a large part of the children go to extracurricular tutoring classes after school.  So believe me, good grades come from extracurricular tutoring classes, not from that school.  The school’s leadership looks kind and polite, but is actually very cold and rude. This school is more like a running company, all for money.  And I believe that there is racial discrimination here, but it is not obvious.  So you can see some people say that school is good because they have been treated differently. Once I worked as a volunteer to help the teacher complete the art work on the corridor wall.  I saw children who had made mistakes were asked to line up and squat down in the corner of the corridor.  They are treated like criminals.  I don't think that humiliating children in this way can make them be better children. Humiliation education is the best manifestation of a teacher's inability to educate.  So what else do I need to say, a school without love and care.",

The school was just what we were looking for with regards to academics. After moving from Europe, we loved that the school provided specialty teachers for many of the subjects like music, PE, Spanish and Mandarin, because we didn't have that option before. They have all enjoyed participating in extra-curricular activities that happen during lunch recess or after school. My girls are so happy with the school and they wouldn't change a thing. I have been pleased with all the teachers and they all have been easy to contact and keep in communication if there are any questions or concerns. I find the teachers always answer emails quickly and I have never had problems scheduling a meeting with them. The administration and staff are always friendly and helpful when I've had questions. I love that many of the staff and the administration know the many of the students names from the Kindercentre all the way up to Grade 12. My daughters are in elementary school now, but I'm happy they will be at Webber Academy through Grade 12. I find the older students, as well as the younger students, are polite and they have great pride and satisfaction in their work and school.

The kids love all the activities they do, the outdoor time, and the menu. Parking can be a bit tight at times (out the front), but once I started using the parking lot out the back, I was always able to get a spot. There have been a couple of very minor administrative issues, but the team were always willing to work with us on them. The biggest standout is the teachers - you could tell they genuinely cared for our children. Wee Wild Ones should do whatever they can to keep them around!",

        "text": "My experience with Wee Wild Ones (WWO) has been on the administrative side and with their unethical business practice of nonrefundable waitlist fees.\n\nThrough my tour of the Fairview centre in May 2022, I was led to believe that with their new Currie location opening in Sep 2022  there would be availability for my two children to attend the Fairview centre. I paid $300 to place my kids on the waitlist, which would be applied to the first month of daycare. Based on what WWO told me, I felt confident that there would be openings for my kids. However, when I contacted WWO in Oct 2022 to inquire about availability for a Dec 2022 start, I was told there were no spots open. When I asked for my $300 to be refunded since I need to find alternative childchare for Dec 2022, I was told they would not refund the $300 waitlist fee.\n\nThis is not standard practice in the childcare realm. Other daycares would only charge parents if they actually have availability. It's deplorable that WWO would charge $150/child waitlist fees for some vague promise of the possibility of placement.",

        "text": "I debated for some time as to whether to leave a review or not. But after some encouragement from other parents…. here it is.\nOur experience with Wee Wild Ones was disappointing and we gave our 30 days’ notice after being there 1 month.\nThe pros:  The centre was bright and esthetically pleasing.  The classroom my son was in had a lot of natural light.  The educators themselves were very nice, and put in great effort for the daily indoor activities and near the end of our time there my son did enjoy being in their care.   We also appreciated the cloth diaper program and the daily reports.\nThe cons: The infant and toddler classrooms were really crowded.  My son napped poorly and came home overstimulated and worn out, which isn’t the case in his new day care.  Drop off parking was tight and busy and there is a ton of traffic in the morning with the high school being right there.\nOur primary issue was with the administration. To summarize, they seemed disorganized, inexperienced with confusing inconsistent policies and communication. One example of this was the repeated confusion over which program they were placing my son in. I had to get this corrected on three separate occasions, including the week before we were to start. There were other issues and conflict as well, which I won’t go into for the review, but happy to share if parents want more details. The first few weeks with WWO ended up being confusing, very stressful and we felt disrespected.\nThe kicker for us was when we followed up with the owner with our experiences, feedback and suggestions (which she had invited us to do) it was met with defensive and passive aggressive communication.  We have never received such a dismissive response from someone in her type of position. It made us realize if this how the owner communicates and handles feedback, this behaviour likely impacts the rest of the organization.\nI recognize our experience may not be the norm.  All I can say is that our current day care has never made us feel the way the management and owner of WWO did.  Plus, our son is thriving at our current day care- so he doing much better as well.  My advice to other parents is approach with caution and a critical eye. Visit it more than once (go when it’s open!!), get things in writing, ask for clarification, and don’t take what they say as “fact”.  This is a business that appears to be expanding, is lacking some experience and is figuring its self out, so they have some “learning” to do. Ultimately trust your gut if it’s the right fit for your family.",

Due to unforseen circumstances we had to pull out our 2 year old son the first week as he did not have a good experience there. We noticed he was sad most of the time on the liveview camera; and our son kept saying hi to one of the lady but she was not responding at all so we felt like our son was being neglected. We know it's a daycare that takes care of a lot of kids but at least put some interest or compassion, and interact with them, especially if its their first week. Our kid was still in a transition period and we were hoping they could have been more understanding and supportive. They are toddlers and they need some attention as well. Our son also got sick on his 3rd day and it is something we didn't expect at all; we heard that kids get sick most of the time if they go to bigger facility, but this is something we never thought would have happened on his 1st week. And lastly, since our kid was only there for 3 days and half, we were hoping that they would have been more understanding with our situation and will only make us pay a portion of it, but no, we still have to pay for a full month. We felt like that they are only doing this just for business and for their own benefit. So our big advice, before signing up..make sure your kid will be able to transition right away, expect for the unexpected and know that you'll be spending a lot of money if it doesn't work out.",

Cameras allow me to peek throughout the day to sooth my momma blues. Staff are exceptional and show genuine affection for all the children in their care. My child's happiness and easy smiles each day a testament to this nurturing environment. Food is well balanced and any special food needs are easily met.",

This location kept giving the same fruits (not much variety ) mostly used to be melons which was hard for infants to chew.\nThe classroom floors seemed like they weren't  mopped for ages, my socks got really dirty after spending an hour during the Christmas party, my child was always sick and I would find out that the teacher took my infant (who was a thumb sucker) to climb the staircase which was used by people with their outdoor shoes! Although the staff members all tried their best to greet you during drops offs and pick ups, it didn't equate in their interaction with the children in the classrooms. The teachers in the infant room looked miserable and didn't seem to enjoy their job.",

She has done an exceptional job in creating an environment that is warm and welcoming not just for the children but for parents as well. She always takes time to address any concerns we may have and ensures that every child’s needs are met. Ms Heather, Ms Yumi and Ms Dorie are absolutely amazing! Their patience and kindness are evident in the way they interact with each child in their care. I have felt so comfortable leaving my daughter with such friendly and caring teachers.\n\nThe facility is clean. There are plenty of toys, books and educational resources available, as well as an outdoor play area that is simply amazing. One thing that really sets this daycare apart is the level of communication and involvement between the staff and parents. We receive daily updates and pictures of our child's activities, which is both reassuring and heartwarming. The camera makes it easy and convenient to check up on my daughter throughout my work day.\n\nI would highly recommend Willowbrae Royal Oak to other parents looking for a safe and engaging place for their child!",

We were in Cambridge ON before and my son went to Willowbrae there as well and we had a very pleasant experience overall. He was a shy kid and he got settled very well.\n\nIn Sundance, Director Hannah is very friendly and responds to everything you ask of her. Sometimes there is not a clear answer in emails when you first sign-up but I think that is because English is not her first language. She is a wonderful person and my son loves all his teachers too. Great part is having a peace of mind as you can see the live cameras on the website or app which makes my day! :)\n\n100% recommend checking this daycare out. Expensive if you do not get a subsidy, but in my opinion, who else do we earn for?",

If you have any questions or concerns you get an answer from Hannah very quickly which is great! I feel like my little one is well taken care of and I find the staff SO WONDERFUL! Miss Jeandy in the infant room is the sweetest, and I can tell my little girl is really opening up and coming out of her shell thanks to the amazing workers, who are also willing to try work with me when it comes to her napping. I had her on a very strict nap schedule prior to daycare so the adjustment has been a bit hard on her, however the willingness to try different things has been great ! Amazing daycare and would recommend !!",

It's a very strict Montessori.\n- initially I was told they would practice mandarin with the kids but after enrollment, they said 3yr olds are too small to learn a 2nd language and they would only speak mandarin/Cantonese to the kids who can already speak it.\n\nUnfortunately this school has the potential to be amazing, but it just isn't there yet.

I've noticed that he has become more adventurous and is growing in his abilities and resilience. I feel that sending him to this preschool was a good decision. The programs offered by this preschool are excellent, but what I admire the most is the dedication and attitude of the teachers and staff toward the children. They embrace the children with love and provide consistent guidance. They also prepare healthy meals with fresh ingredients for the children every day. Since my son started attending Wise Kids Academy, he looks forward to going to preschool every day. He even waits eagerly for the days he can go, even on weekends and holidays.

The shy and quite toddler boy who was watching other kids to play and feeling afraid of trying things on his own has grown to a confident, energetic and personable boy who says hi to other people first and goes out to try new adventures outdoor or anywhere. Now my 3 years daughter is following her brother’s path there too. She is loving it so much everyday. Montessori programs with different ages helping them from the youngest to the oldest in all different way and helping them learn things even with toddlers’ strong will of independence. She is very proud of herself being able to do many things on her own there and learning in same time! Forest time is my favourite thing of  Kids program. Kids get to play outside getting dirty, muddy, watery in nature (in Actual nature not in playground) learning all sorts of things with all 5 senses, watching and feeling all different weathers in 4 seasons. All parents must know how hard to put the proper gears for each season from putting sunscreen and bug spray to putting boots and snow suits gloves and hats and so on. AMAZING Wise Kids teachers do this everyday!!! If anyone who is looking for a truly caring child care provider for 3 years and older, I highly recommend to contact Ms. Sunny or DM me. I can share all my 3 years experiences with Wise Kids Academy. Your kids will have the BEST childhood memories to remember for whole life.\n\nForever thanks to Ms. Sunny, Ms. Jin, Ms. Tiger, Ms. Ellie, Ms. Erin, Ms. Anne, Ms. Sandy, Ms. Sonya and Ms. Gloria, our kids have grown so well with your care and love.",

This preschool's commitment to the Montessori philosophy, personalized approach, comprehensive curriculum, safe environment, and supportive community make it a truly exceptional institution. I am immensely grateful to Zebra Crossing Academy for providing my child with a solid foundation and instilling a lifelong love for learning.\n\nThank you, Zebra Crossing Academy !!!",

        "text": "I doubt staff will see this post and care much as there is a mix of positive and negative reviews, but the negative ones are not met with constructive criticism. This leads me to believe nothing will be done in my case which is fine. I hope this post can help others to make an educated decision.\n\nI can only judge based on my experience, but this company did a poor job of handling our situation. We have recently moved to Calgary from Ontario. Finding daycare for your child is difficult to say the least.\n\nWe were recommended to Zebra Crossing by someone who has used their services in the past. When we spoke with the mahogany center, they advised that registration was full and turnover was far and few between. They made it clear that we would need to be on a waitlist if we wanted any chance to have our two year old enrolled. The waitlist was also full and we were told, if something became available, they would let us know.\n\nWe were told we would have to pay a deposit and that would be applied to the first month registration fee. Unfortunately, when we moved to Calgary, we were forced to settle into a different community. We thought, okay we will get back our deposit and enroll our child in a different facility. We were providing good notice and as we were told the waitlist was full. The assumption was there were many others to take out place. The harm no loss.\n\nWhen we informed the staff at Zebra Crossing that we no longer required the waitlist, we would be moving on, they become defensive and said that we would need to talk to head office. This was my first clue something fishy was going on. Charlotte advised me someone from head office would call me back.\n\nThere was no call! There was a poorly put together email from Sameer Khakhi: manager of accounting finance & operations that read \"there was no deposit paid, only a signup/registration fee\". I was furious. I sent an email explaining, that I understand that we may have inconvenienced the business (which I don't understand if the capacity was full). I also, offered to give some of the $400 that was held hostage to them as good faith for their time. No one has even replied. $400 for a registration fee for a daycare your soon isn't attending? $400 to remain on the waitlist? And if you don't join, you lose the money? NO! This is cruel.\n\nBest of luck to anyone that goes here. Just wanted to make sure our family's voice was heard.\n\nRegards,\n\nChristopher Campbell",

When I contacted them in Oct/Nov 2022 asking for a spot in Feb/Mar 2023, they seemed positive and reassured me that there were openings - asked me to pay the priority waitlist $150 which I did. Got an email in December saying that we will be informed of placement in 2 weeks - that was it!\nI was depending on them for childcare March onwards and I kept emailing and they kept saying they are full. They contacted me 2 weeks back saying they have a spot 3 days per week from JUNE!!!\nVery unreliable - the initial strategy of 'yes we have a spot' was to entice people to pay for the priority waitlist and then they disappear on you.",

        "text": "This looks to me more like a children’s mill than a daycare. I had a bad experience and took my daughter to another daycare even though I had left 6 more paid weeks.\nThey don’t hire enough teachers for all registered children, this practice is called overbooking, so every day, any reason is good to send the child back home, it’s very stressful to never know if your child will be accepted or not while you have to drop her and go to work. In the middle of the day, every reason is good to call you to take back your child and keep harassing you to come pick her up in the same hour, this way they can hire some teachers only part time and save more bucks (anticipating the fact that they will send back home some children in the afternoon).\nWhen you don't take your child to daycare, they call (after 10am, just to be sure you will not try to drop her after their call) and try by all means to make you say that she is sick so they have an excuse to not accept her for the next days.\nAlso even if the school is big, children are always in a small room, worse, each time I went there in the middle of the day, I always found them confined in a small corner of the room, and this gives the children barely 2 sq ft of space each.  In winter they never see daylight. This “daycare” will never do more than what is strictly mandatory by the law and will always find a way to apply every penalty or constraint they made you sign in the contract. They never care about children’s fulfillment. Last time I was there, because it was few minutes after 10am, they took a toy from my daughter’s hand, put her out of class like garbage, she was shocked because she didn’t understood why, this was the last time they saw us.",

        "text": "Highly recommend this daycare.\n\nThe staff are all super friendly and amazing with the kids, attentive, and patient. Everyday when we walk in to drop off or pick up our daughter, all of the staff take the time to say hello/goodbye and engage with her (and us) which she loves. It makes us feel very welcome and comfortable.\n\nThe facility is nice, organized, and very clean. Lots of variety of activities and toys for each age group. They take care of infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and before and after school care for older kids. They provide healthy meals and snacks.\n\nMy favourite part is getting to see all the pictures from that day posted on the parents group page. They always look like they are having such a fun time.\n\nI would love to shout out a few people, but that wouldn’t be fair because they are ALL amazing. I never have to worry about my daughter when I’m at work. I know she is in great hands!",

My Daughter has been attending Little Owl for the last four and a half years, and she is always excited to go back the next day. In the time she has been there, I can't recall a single issue that we've had with the centre.\nOne of the highlights is the daily report and pictures that are sent out on their activities, as it shows you what they did during the day. My daughter loves to look at it after school and explain to me everything they did - we also hear how great the lunch and snacks are all the time! My daughter has also made a lot of good friends there, and not just with the children, but a lot of the staff as well. Since she has been there so long, she has been through all the rooms in the centre and all the teachers she has had were fantastic. The staff at Little Owl have done an exceptional job at providing an environment that helps her grow as a little girl, and also giving her an environment to learn and be creative in. Send your kid here, you'll be glad you did.",

HOWEVER UPON ARRIVAL I WAS STOPPED AT THE DOOR WITH MY CHILD IN HIS STROLLER AND TOLD THEYD GIVEN MY SPOT AWAY 15 MINUTES BEFORE I SHOWED UP.\nUpon asking them to clarify that they had given my spot away. And they said yes in the last 1 hour they had indeed done just that! Even when I reserved it A WEEK PRIOR when I questioned the lady as to why the blonde lady smirked at me and nodded not saying a word.\nMy son is visibly special needs and I am aware that they lied to avoid taking him on to care for him even though HE HAS AN AIDE THAT THEY HAD CONTACT INFO FOR.\nTerrible daycare terrible service! Also I noticed when I walked in that they had a jungle gym Tree about 9 or 10 feet tall where kids were climbing unsupported and unsupervised. I also noticed that THERE WERE NO STAFF IN THE PRESCHOOL AND TODDLER ROOM but THERE SURE WERE ALOT ABOUT 5 OF THEM IN THE STAFF ROOM AWAY FROM ALL THE KIDS .\n\nUn hindsight super glad I won't have to deal with such a place",

They love their teachers and all the staff. Everyone is so loving and they care for my kids as if they are their own. They provide a daily report that details everything a parent would want to know about their day so we can ask questions and discuss the day. Each classroom is equipped with a camera with secure access for parents / grandparents to view our kids when we miss them. This gives us such peace of mind to just take a peek at their day. They go outside everyday as long as it isn't unsafe to do so with weather. There is a great private playground out back for kids to play in. They do so many fun activities and field trips. The facility is very well organized and clean. I would highly recommend this daycare center to any parent and couldn't be happier with the care my kids get. Thank you Barbara and team :)",

The three educators in the room are all incredible and so kind. I was nervous my daughters' first week and Linda reassured me that she would treat my daughter like her own, and she really has. 🥺\nI don't know the educators in the other rooms as well, but they always make a point to say hi to us when we arrive in the morning and bye when we're leaving, and it's honestly so appreciated.\nThe ladies in the room always keep us very well informed. If she gets hurt (even a minor scrape) they let us know and they fill out an incident report.\nThey plan really fun and engaging activities for the toddlers in the room. Lots of painting, colouring, sensory activities, music, parachute, bubbles, they even saw a turtle one day!\nOne of my favourite parts of the daycare is that they use an app that sends me pictures and updates of what she's doing throughout the day.\nIf I had to think of one critique it would just be that not all of the food they serve is made in house. I know that some daycares have their own chef, but A Place to Grow is also quite affordable compared to others. They allow parents to send their own food to supplement their menu. With the money we save here we can buy her more fruit to send for snacks! Lol\nOverall I would, (and have been) recommending this daycare to my friends!",

I did research and asked Many questions. But I chose this daycare because the director’s answers fit me. My baby was 1 year and my 4 year old has two disabilities. And so you can tell how worried I must have been. But choosing them, was one of the best things I have ever done. They are so caring, professional, friendly how they always smile and welcome the person. Every person is important to them . They report and write down for parents of what children did that day and what they ate. They follow the rules and guidelines well. It is a safe, secure and clean place. All my doubts were gone and I always felt I am leaving my babies with people I can trust. The staff are well educated and might even give few suggestions for your children. And they are always open to suggestions from parents. This daycare is 100% great!",

It was alarming to see ratios were repeatedly not maintained. I counted up to 17 mixed age kids all together with one worker several times. It was common to pick up our child in a soiled diaper. They have an outdoor area, but do not use it. The snow and ice is seldom cleared for safe access. Fish crackers are the staple food. Several times I came in quietly to see children huddled around a workers phone (I don’t blame the workers, they had far too many kids to handle by themselves). Our child afterwards told us they were locked in a room by themselves at times.  I cannot recommend this daycare to anyone I know or don’t know. Very disappointing.",

We deeply appreciate and believe in their Reggio-inspired child care approach, which emphasizes hands-on discovery learning.

The administrator; Devaki is very devoted and excellent at implementing new strategies to  improve childcare. The facility has outstanding educators who are polite, professional and friendly. Also, the environment is clean and organized. Their daily routine keeps my little one engaged as they do so many fun and educative activities. He improved with sitting and paying attention, \"self-eating\" as well. My son is always happy to go to daycare every morning and i think this is the right place for your little one. Thanks team Allard Daycare. I do RECOMMEND this daycare to any parent who is looking for something more than just a daycare.",

First time my son had hard time being separated from us(besides, his mother tongue is not English), but we tried to work with experienced teachers. Now, with their supports and practical help, he's become stronger and more confident, and knows how to cope and manage when problems occurred. And he's got very socialized and active too. Teachers are working very hard, arranging various activities(including outdoor activities), I love they sent us pictures during the day so I could see what my son is learning on that day and how’s he doing there, and we could talk about his day when he got home. Teachers are willing to communicate with parents and they take care of kids as their own ones. They love kids and my son love them too. Special thanks to teacher Gulalay and Devaki and Nasreen. We will miss this daycare so much. And we absolutely recommend this day care.",

I paid the $100 registration fee and enrolled my daughter only to find out the numbers they gave me were incorrect even though I clearly asked them for the break down. I spoke to someone through email and over the phone and both individuals gave me different numbers. For a 50+ year old daycare, you'd expect them to know what subsidy and affordability amount is included and give the proper breakdown. My daughter went in for 2 half days and they tried to sneakily charge my husband for the full time fee. If he didn't inquire about the steep pricing, they probably would've gotten away with it. Definitely BE CAREFUL if you're considering this place. All they really care about is your money.",

It's an amazing daycare/OSC that is not only subsidized (therefore, have to adhere to regulations and occasional surprised inspections from the government) but believes in the Montessori learning objectives with very competitive child care cost. If you want to provide your child with a great foundation prior to Kindergarten, this is the place. My daughter (who's currently 4) know how to spell, identify, and write her name. She can also do basic mathematics, pronounce proper English words, and problem solve (think outside the box concept). Besides all those great things, Mrs. Barbar treats the kids like her own, she will discipline (not physically or yelling or anything like that) like how any mother would want to teach when a child does something that is wrong. For example, I've witness her telling another OSC child that she's asked that child not to do that numerous times and why she would think that's a good idea. They were in another room, so I know it wasn't an act. So, if you want a Montessori program that incorporates realistic value learning environment for your child and their growing minds, this is a wonderful option.",

A number of long term staff who are clearly experienced. Plus options like lunch programs and vans taking the boys to kinder in Sept. And the cleanliness exceeds expectations.\n\nThe best place I could imagine to care for my kids!",

        "text": "I am disgusted with this daycare and its owner. While I didn't have many issues with the staff, the owner, on the other hand, made my daughter seem like a burden. For context, my daughter has some developmental delays, and Amy has blamed everything from the team quitting to going on stressful leave because of my daughter. Multiple times my child has come home with diaper rashes so nasty she would have open sores and be in so much pain, she could hardly walk. When I brought this up to Amy, she would gaslight me on the issues and tell me my daughter made everything complex for the staff. Even though we had workers there assuring us and updating us on the leaps in progress our daughter has made. Please reconsider sending your children to this daycare, if you can even call it that. This has been one of my worst failures as a parent allowing this person to care for my child, and I hope no other family has to deal with such incompetence.\nFor a daycare that prides itself on inclusivity, they are far from that, especially when dealing with children with special needs.",

We dropped everything and drove there then took her to emergency.\n\nShe couldn't move her arm at all without excruciating pain.\n\nThey had paired younger kids with older ones, while understaffed, sort of letting the older kids watch the little ones. Great idea. Except they are just kids too and accidents will happen. The older kid was much taller and was running holding hands with my little one and yanked her arm in a way it shouldn't move... her tendon popped out of place around her elbow.\n\nI was really disappointed that the older girl was blamed for this. No one comforted her. She was crying in the corner. Feeling guilty.\n\nThe staff was only concerned with deflecting blame - onto a child. It fell on us, the parents of the badly injured kid - to comfort the older girl before we left for the hospital.\n\nThe character of a place is easier to see in an emergency. Bad culture here. They need to respect their own staff. Respect them. Train them. Pay them well. Don't play games with our kids. Trying to have more kids than staff, taking in more kids... Trying to maximize profits.

They make nutritional and diverse food, which my picky eater enjoys. The staff at Appleton is like a second family for me, which I appreciate as it is always hard to have your child cared for by someone other than yourself. I always feel confident that my child will have a good day, her needs will be met, and she will  learn something of value when she is at day home. I highly recommend Appleton, and am grateful for their amazing facility and continued exceptional service.",

The daycare has been an excellent place far. During The time my kids attended this daycare, there has been ownership change as well.. The current owner has been really good in communicating with us and solving any issues. We are happy here and we like the smaller house like feeling of the daycare. The kids all know each other well (tight-knit community) and are able to interact with each other of different age groups which is good for their development.\n\nThe price of this daycare is also the most affordable I have seen for this central area. I like that they took real care on making the fees affordable for parents which really help during these days when the cost of  everyday living have increased.",

I’m not sure of the qualifications of the staff members.\n\nOrganization and communication could be improved.\n\nWe ultimately pulled our son due to the way the centre was unable to support potty training. At about 20 months old I asked the manager how the centre would support my son as I planned on potty training, her response was, “just let the staff know and they will follow your lead.” Our first attempt was unsuccessful, and a few months later when picking him up he said he needed to poop. I asked the same manager if I could take him to their potty and she explained they didn’t have an accessible toilet attached to the infant room (up to 2.5 years) he was in.\nWe ended up stopping attempts at that point, but he started withholding his bowel movements (resulting in multiple small poops in each day). Three days in a row I came to pick him up and staff were changing him and complaining how often he pooped and lecturing him about how he should use the potty.\nI corrected them and explained it wasn’t fair to tell him that if he wasn’t actually able to use the potty at the daycare.\nI couldn’t believe they were shaming him. I didn’t take him back after that day.\n\nHe’s been at a new centre for less than a month and part-time, and now is almost fully potty trained.\n\nWhen he was a baby I think the centre provided the support he needed, but I’m not sure the centre or staff in the baby room are equipped or set up well to support toddlers.",

As she got a bit older and started to age out of the room, her interactions with similar aged children became problematic and stressful for her.  She became so stressed and scared of the other children she would become sick.  She, a four year old at the time, was being beaten and bullied by a 3yr old male and nothing was being done about it.  The older child room (kindergarten and up) where my son was, was quite rowdy.  My son found it far too loud, and far too stressful.  In the summer, particularly last summer, almost the entire summer was spent in the hot school gymnasium rather than outside in the huge neighbourhood park.  The vast majority of summer programming was cancelled.  It was basically baby jail.  In the last one or two years this daycare has drastically dropped in the quality of care.",

They give you no time to eat your lunch and after won’t let you grab your outside stuff if you forgot it by your classroom. They have no activities for the older children. There are a lot of bullies in the daycare, one time some girl (grade 6 a few years ago) cried because we weren’t playing with her even though she didn’t ask to play with us when we went to the table and didn’t even talk to her at all. 4 year olds swear and so do the other kids. They make the boys go into the girls bathroom. You are forced into the gym after school to just sit on the bench while watching the littler kids slobber all over the newly polished floors and ride bikes that your not allowed touching. Kids will bite you and scratch you for no typical reason. Some of my stuff has went missing while having to go to this daycare. They bring ALL the kids to see Elmo, which for me I was really scared of him with his creepy laugh. When they served snacks they’d give you a tiny cup full and say you don’t get anymore. You have to pay like $260 for 2 kids when their only at the daycare after school, before, and at lunch. The question is how much you’ll have to pay when their in kindergarten or not even in school yet. Overall I would suggest NEVER bringing your kids to this daycare.",

Because of this, is why review is so poor. Her lack of communication has been very unprofessional and has left me scrambling for daycare 2 weeks from when I need it for son. I had him on the waitlist since July, have been asking for updates to confirm he has Spot and she said there wouldn't be any foreseeable issues for when we needed him in. I sent an email, having heard from a staff member that there was no space for my son,when I need childcare in 2 weeks and she said that there is no place for him now. Why was my daycare status being discussed among staff first when nothing had been communicated to me directly? As someone who runs the center I think she should more than understand how important childcare is so parents could work. She did not communicate any of this to me after we had been checking in, as I'm sure she would have had some indication much sooner than 2 weeks prior that there'd be no space. her behavior regarding this matter contradicts everything center stands for and expects from their employees according to their website.",

The director took every concern we ever had seriously, and was so supportive. Extremely professional and authentic interactions. We moved and had to say goodbye, but my preschool kids STILL talk about how much they love and miss Beverly Daycare! They absolutely hate their new one. I honestly wish we could airlift Beverly Daycare to our new province!! We will never find another like it! The bar has honestly been set so high by this organization! A++++++++++",

I might give this place another chance one day.\n\nOriginal review:\nAbsolutely horrible experience, I would never recommend this place. I couldn't even use the services because the staff was so unhelpful. It's like they don't know who the people they're helping are or something. I just needed respite and they had so many arbitrary rules about specific stop off and pickup times, and they had no common sense. Like my kids are so bored with the endless paperwork that they are becoming destructive and bouncing off the walls so I asked if the kids could go in while I finish the paperwork and the lady says no. Like ok then stop going off on my kids for playing with the automatic door, they both have ADHD, I'm exhausted and looking for respite because I need help. And yet you guys can't even be a bit helpful to a person in need. Never reccomending this service to anyone.",

From the start, Violet was very kind to wait for me after work to give me the tour. Teacher Kazi would give hugs to my baby when she was upset, and I knew she was in good hands. Their playground in the back is fantastic. They always sent me daily photos and even more if my daughter was crying when I left.\n\nWhen she turned 2.5yrs old, she moved to the other side with the older kids, where she made good friends, and teacher Evelyn was taking care of her and letting me know of all that happened. I appreciate the honesty and concern, so that we worked together to educate her. Sangam and Sukhman are also very helpful and supportive of the kids. My daughter says she has many favourite teachers. In particular, teachers Raj, Dilpreet, Meena, Sunita, Merci, really helped my daughter grow in confidence and gave me peace of mind when I’m worried about her. This is a fantastic location and I am really happy to have trusted this team for so long. I am sad now to change to another daycare because we moved too far, but we will cherish many happy moments from this place, from fieldtrips and barbecues and so much more. I would highly recommend this daycare to anyone.",

My husband and I were nervous sending our kids to daycare - it was the first time and they had never been apart or been in someone else’s care for any extended periods especially 5 days a week. I can honestly feel at ease knowing that I don’t have to worry about my kids, being a store manager my schedule can be a bit hectic but Eeshani is always accommodating and the staff are always happy to help with smiling faces at drop off and pick up ! They helped us with our subsidy application as it was our first time applying and when things got mixed up, it took 8 months to resolve and not once was I made to feel uncomfortable or like I was doing something wrong. They were so understanding and patient with the entire process even though there were very few and far between updates! I would highly recommend this daycare if you want your kids to be taken care of by kind and compassionate people who are amazing with children ! Our youngest is now walking and talking more as well as our oldest who has never had a day where she didn’t want to go to daycare !",

Another thing I really like is the creative ideas they have for the children to do - this summer they have done a \"mud day\", taken them for a picnic, taken them to an indoor playground, as well as to a local splash park. They are always coming up with fun things to do! Elsa and Marshall even visited one day!\n\nThe teachers are very caring and professional, and both of my kids have really bonded with their teachers and the friends in their classes :) Highly recommend Bright Horizons!",

        "text": "*UPDATED after reply*: I said that I pulled him from his old daycare because he didn’t want to continue going after they went under new ownership, he didn’t like the new owners and staff after going there for a year and a half. I also confronted them over cutting his fingernails, which daycares aren’t allowed to do. But I didn’t bother to tell you they were mistreating him and that is why I pulled him out of there. And I brought him regularly in the mornings for the first month, after he refused to go I knew I would continue having a hard time considering your response and how you handle things. So I started bringing him less and less, until it because obvious that he would never be happy going here. Plus, you told me everyone else brings their kids at lunch time and you only have 1 kid in the morning anyways. Thanks for also texting me minutes after I post this review, asking if I’d give you guys another chance and bring him back. Don’t you have kids to be watching instead of jumping on your phones as soon as you get a review? And trying to mend it hoping I’ll delete this. There are also fake reviews on here written by the owners themselves off fake accounts.\n\nMy son went here for one month and then I could not get him to continue going. They seem like they do not know how to handle a child throwing tantrums or dealing with separation anxiety, which is normal in toddlers. Each morning my son would cry while dropping him off and the daycare workers would stand there staring at me and wincing in awkwardness not knowing what to do. This is my first time seeing this at any daycare, and I have been dealing with daycares for about 10 years now as I have an older child.\nThe final day I attempted to take him, he cried and they suggested I take him in one of the rooms and try to out him down for a nap. I rejected that offer, as it is not my responsibility to put my child down for a nap at daycare. Imagine if I had somewhere to be at a certain time and I could not spend time sitting there waiting for him to adjust because they simply don’t want to or don’t know how to deal with it. At that point, you might as well put me on payroll and I can forget about finding work else where and I can do your job while spending time there, and make money at the same time.\nNot sure why they chose to handle the situation in that way, but it gives off the impression that you don’t know how to take care of children especially in times of their distress. I don’t feel comfortable bringing my child here anymore.",

The daycare has been also open during the pandemic initially for essential workers and now for everyone else, which made possible for me to work  (I am a social worker). The staff is super friendly, patient, creative, and knowledgeable. They were the 1st to recommend a speech assessment for my daughter,  which resulted in timely diagnosis and services offered at school leading to significant improvement.

At least this is what was told to me. I was asked by Anna to not bring my son from July.She has stuffed 18 kids in a room and putting pressure on teachers. Such was her ignoring my son that no photos or any updates was made on that app they have.\nHer cold attitude started when I didnot go for Brightpath's PUF program and chose another one instead.After losing the funding,she started creating hurdles so that I self willingly discontinue.She told no outside programs will be allowed whereas daycares cannot refuse out of reach PUF program for a child.When all these didnot work,she had to say that I have taken other kids and you have to discontinue.\nMany have positive reviews because their children can adjust here without any extra help,but not all kids are same. But if a special needs child comes,you get to see Anna's real face.\nEverytime I walked into that door,she would start sulking.Just had enough of her.",

My child eagerly looks forward to attending and has made significant strides in learning.\n\nThe daily activities are both captivating and instructive. Communication with parents is top-notch, with consistent progress updates provided during pickup. It's truly comforting to know that my little one is under such capable care throughout the day.\n\nIf there's one aspect I'd suggest enhancing, it would be more frequent parent-teacher one-on-one meetings. Nevertheless, their overall performance remains fantastic",

Honestly they all are, there are really too many to name. Everyone has been so kind and attentive and accommodating whenever I have a question or request.\n\nThe educators are also absolutely wonderful. Meenakshi and Jashin (room G) and Sangita (formerly room G) were so caring and just hands down incredible with my son. It was so hard to transition him out of the room because he loves them so much, as do we!\n\nHowever, he's recently moved up to pre-school and his new teachers are also so warm and kind and caring and go above and beyond, especially to make him feel comfortable during the transition phase. They are very attentive and the detailed reports are extremely appreciated.\n\nHe has learned so much from being at Brightpath and there is no way I would have been able to have taught him anywhere near the amount that he knows because of attending. The curriculum is jaw dropping and so well rounded, I am constantly blown away when I see the reports of what he is learning.\n\nNever would have imagined my son would know his left and right's before he was 3! Nor would I have ever thought to even attempt to teach him that at such a young age.\n\nPrice wise of course you'll be paying more than a smaller centre or a dayhome, but in my opinion it's WELL worth it. We looked at the prices of surrounding centres that have opened up since he has been attending here and while we would be saving a couple hundred dollars a month elsewhere, the savings were not at all worth taking him out of this incredible centre.\n\nBravo Brightpath and bravo Heather for such a well run centre.",

They check kids temperature every morning, wash their hands frequently and santize the toys regularly.

        "text": "My recent encounter with Cambridge Daycare was an absolute nightmare. Their behavior over the phone was beyond rude and left me utterly appalled. I initially called them to inquire about a water purifier, and their response was nothing short of abhorrent.\n\nDuring my first call, the staff member informed me that they were in a meeting and abruptly asked me to call back later. Fair enough, I called back as requested. However, when I made the second call, the individual who answered was incredibly dismissive and impolite. Their lack of professionalism was evident as they impatiently told me to \"get to the point\" and repeatedly responded with a disdainful \"yeah yeah.\"\n\nThis level of disrespect and condescension is absolutely unacceptable. It's astonishing that a daycare center, which should prioritize the well-being and care of children, would treat potential clients in such a derogatory manner. I am deeply disturbed by the utter lack of customer service skills displayed by Cambridge Daycare's staff.\n\nBased on this encounter alone, I would strongly advise parents to steer clear of Cambridge Daycare. The callous and rude behavior exhibited by their staff suggests a complete disregard for providing a safe, nurturing environment for children. If they cannot even handle a simple phone conversation with basic courtesy, one can only imagine how they might treat children and their families in person.\n\nI implore anyone seeking quality child care services to seek alternatives to Cambridge Daycare. The unprofessionalism and disrespect demonstrated during my call indicate a deeply troubling lack of professionalism and care within their establishment. Please, for the sake of your child's well-being, look elsewhere for a daycare center that values both courtesy and the welfare of the children they serve.",

        "text": "Attention to detail is of the utmost importance at Cambridge Daycare. My son started there in 2014 and now my daughter is there and the staff is largely the same since we first arrived.\nThe friendliest atmosphere, the kids explore through arts and crafts and have the opportunity to read and be read to. It's an educational environment with a wide range of toys and puzzles that prepares kids for their schooling years. Staff take extra care to communicate how my child is behaving and cooperating with the others. Monthly emails reporting on activities and progress are sent and timely emails regarding changes in policies or important information keep parents up to date with expectations and requirements.\nI personally witnessed the work that went into the location change and the commitment made by everyone to make the transition. It is something to see. The layout of the new daycare is incomparable to any other. Plenty of open space with natural daylight streaming in, modernized kitchen, sinks and washrooms in every section. The pedway that centers the space is unique and beautifully constructed. The playground outside is inviting and spacious for kids to run and play.\nThere is a family feel to this place. I recommend it to anyone in search of a daycare for their child.",

        "text": "My kids have both loved CDO! What I love about it is that it is one of the only full day preschools in Edmonton. No dropping of my 3 year old for a 2 hour program just to turn around and drive right back for pickup. CDO runs from 9am-3pm! They go outside every day, and they do tons of large motor activities and arts and crafts throughout the day. Both of my kids have gone together this year which I also really like. The teachers are great and the program is positive and inclusive.\nCDO is by far the most cost effective option too. With the new government subsidy the cost of sending kids 2 days a week is under $100/child a month!!\nThe volunteer portion and fundraising requirement are a little annoying, but I like that these keep the cost down for families. We paid out of the volunteer commitment this year as it worked better for our family.\nThe facility is older and I wish they did more music in the program, but those are minor complaints.  My kids are always excited to go in the morning and happy at the end of the day. You can’t beat that! Highly recommend!",

My youngest misses Miss Ziniira the most.\nI felt very welcomed when I was new to the program. However, as the years progressed, it became very toxic to be volunteering for the parent board. I was never recognized for my efforts; other parent board members who left the program were White and I am Chinese. I felt discriminated against. I helped the school save more than $120 in bank fees a year by getting them to change their bank account types. This school is great if you have a great support system and if you have retired parents who can help. This preschool is not very inclusive or welcoming towards busy working parents with little to no support system. I have since found a better preschool with less volunteering requirements — and more importantly, no casino volunteering.",

When I confronted the director about this, she denied it and said that it had never happened. I had four other people that I trusted confirming that it did happen. Eventually they changed the policy but still refused to acknowledge their mistake. I filed a complaint and as a result the director retaliated. She called my funding to complain that I ask too many questions and would not bring them an entire box of diapers at once. She also complained that I had filed a complaint. After this I gave my immediate notice. This daycare is not worth the drama. The prices are great but food wise you get what you pay for.

I chose Country Club above all options. Samantha, the owner, and her team of care givers (teachers including Carrie, Maria, Shania and Gazelle to name a few) are like second moms to my kids. The kiddos love the variety of activities and the morning oatmeal! I love the pick-up/drop-off to school, lunches, outdoor play, and PD Day coverage that is included! Additionally, Samantha was always very diligent about making sure I was receiving the maximum amount of financial support through all government programs. These ladies are exceptional.

The worst daycare center with incompetent teachers who traumatize children. My child was constantly pushed and beaten by another child, and the teachers did not react or notify me about this situation. I learned about the bullying from my two-year-old child. But the educators kept silent all the time and said that everything was fine, although I asked them more than once if they noticed that my daughter was hurt by another child. My child stopped sleeping at night and started pulling out her hair when she he was nervous. After visiting a psychologist it turned out that my child was traumatized by the experience of attending this kindergarten. These are the most incompetent teachers who do not care about your children at all. They are obliged to provide your child with physical and emotional safety within the walls of the center, but I did not see it. If you want your children to be abused and you know nothing about it - come to this daycare, your child will be traumatized for the rest of their life. I am very disappointed and angry.

As we toured the facility, something inside me said “this feels like a good match for our family.” I’m glad I trusted my gut because I could not have been more right. Our daughter was well cared for, made many great friends, learned so much and was always greeted with a big smile. The facility is well kept and clean. The staff always have fun and engaging learning opportunities planned. Words can express how much we would recommend Creekwood.

This has been our experience at Curious Learners.\n\nThe Director, Tammy Yulo, is a phenomenally dedicated, knowledgeable, nurturing and caring professional with a unique vision for the Centre.  She fearlessly leads her team of loving supportive educators/staff. We appreciate that there is constant feedback and communication. They even display and share insightful stories in the Centre of growth, experiences and interactions of the children and staff. These are happy such things to see.\n\nWe signed on after speaking with Tammy as she immediately was interested in sharing her experience and experiences to help our children. One of the main goals was making life easier at home with the daycare helping with transitions. We toured the facility and she instantly bonded with them and they with her, feeling very comfortable playing there for the first time. She made it a great experience.\n\nThe daycare gem is a newly-opened, spacious and well-maintained facility which is constantly improving. Located near a nice park/playground/spray park, it is in an ideal location. There is also a rooftop play area as well. The children enjoy healthy, nutritious home-cooked meals and snacks which are included. Staff are extremely diligent on cleaning and sanitizing all environments. Children are respected and assisted to progress with their best interest, independence and development in mind. They are helped to reach their potential.\n\nOur kids love going there every day. They have their own special place that is safe, healthy, educational, loving and nurturing which allows them to progress and be kids at their own pace with the staff and other children. They and we look upon everyone as a second family. Our kids are flourishing at Curious Learners and I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend them!",

It made us immediately comfortable leaving our child here.\n\nWhen you walk in, you see happy kids, happy teachers and happy assistants. The staff have all been there for a long time, and I think both of those things speak to the positive environment here.\n\nWe all want our kids to be in a safe and positive place, and feel loved when we can’t be with them.

        "text": "I have nothing but but positive reviews for Discovery Nest. As a first time parent, my partner and I looked into multiple daycare and day home establishments. None gave as good a first impression as Discovery Nest. The facility is well laid out, well equipped, clean, and welcoming. The entire staff is friendly, responsive, and seem to have made a genuine connection with our child.\n\nDiscovery Nest uses the Brightwheel app to keep us informed of activities throughout the day -  we're informed of his nap lengths, what his meals are and how much is eaten, and all potty events. It keeps communication regarding needed supplies and upcoming activities very straightforward and easy to keep track of. Best of all, we get activity updates and photos throughout the day.\n\nMost importantly, though, our child is excited to go to daycare. He's happy when we pick him up, and lights up at the sight of the employees when we drop him off (he's under 2yrs so no direct feedback from him yet!). He is picking up skills, language, and positive behaviors that constantly surprise us. There is an obvious emphasis on education of the children.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Discovery Nest to any family looking for a daycare.\n\nUPDATE: Four years have passed, and our little one has now moved on into kindergarten. We're only a week into the transition, but that time has given me much more appreciation for everything Discovery Nest has done for him. He is thriving! There were no tears at the first drop-off. He was excited, eager, and ready to be there. On his first day, he mediated a dispute between two other children (\"they needed to take turns, so I got a timer\"). We've received very positive feedback from his educators - he's friendly, polite, attentive, and a joy to have in the class. Now, I'd love for my partner and I to take all the credit for that, but it's painfully obvious that the skills that have set him up best are the ones he learned at daycare.\nScarlett, Gloria, and the rest of the fantastic team there - THANK YOU!",

Starting daycare with a child that was born at the start of the covid pandemic was an uncomfortable feeling but Discovery Nest staff were so kind, thoughtful and professional. The daycare facility has a homely feel, the staff are happy and so caring and warm towards the children. My girl loves attending she is encouraged to learn new skills and enjoys the activities which are always varied, child centered and purposeful. The communication is also fantastic, I'm always kept upto date on my child's day and to be able to see the photos during my working breaks gives me a smile. Thank you Discovery Nest!!!!",

They communicate quickly with parents, and I always trust that my child is in very good hands. The programming is evidence-based, contemporary, varied, and puts the child’s learning and wellness first. Everyday is filled with developmentally appropriate activities (with environmentally friendly materials) that are inclusive and diverse. The language and problem-solving strategies that are used with the children are similarly intentional and thoughtful. The activities are then posted regularly on an app, thus helping parents feel connected to the Centre. The Directors/Educators ask for parental input into the activities and are so responsive to feedback. Guidelines and regulations are rigorously thought-out and make us feel safe even in a pandemic. Our kiddo loves having new adventures and dare I say sleeps/eats better at the Nest than at home! Thank you to the educators for your hard work, dedication, and genuine care for our children!",

It’s just a piece of paper that says they have special learning needs and unfortunately they won’t be met.  Funding not being available …. Ever. Even when ask by our paediatrician.",

It didn't help that he was special needs and a non-verbal.The most horrific thoughts would come to my mind knowing that he wouldn't be able to communicate with his new teachers and share with me his day. Rideau Park has been a magical intervention straight from the Heavens above for him. Its like God especially hand picked a team of exceptional human beings to take care of him and shape his weaknesses into strengths and his strengths into power. I am sure you must wonder how I am writing this review in just two months of him being part of the system... its because in just two months my child comes home as a calm , organized child. Empowered with sign language that I could never have imagined him to be using and comprehending. The wisdom, patience and experience that these three ladies exhilarate is beyond words. (didn't share their names as i hadn't taken permission from the school)The endless energy they exhilarate is almost infectious. Having them in my son's life i feel he can conquer anything .They have opened unlimited possibilities with their knowledge. A small school driven only by passion, kindness and remarkable attention to detail. Just what any special needs would require. Indebted for life!!",

I think me not having the same beliefs had huge impact on my experience at that school. my teacher at the time really did not like me and i was not bad kid sure i wasn't perfect but i was i grade two. i sat outside of the class almost everyday and got in trouble a lot which i have never really experience other than this school. kids even bullied me and once someone stole something from my backpack and instead of trying to figure who it was she got mad at me and i had to stay in for recess i was. another time i got in huge trouble was when i accidently said oh my god and a lot of people from my class started to be mean but my teacher yelled at me and said she was going to call my parents over such a small thing i understand how that can be disrespectful but i was in grade 2. this was all a while ago but i really hope this school mainly my teacher to teach students with respect.",

We left there feeling confident that they cared about children and that they would do their best to help him be successful. Since he’s been there  we have noticed major improvements, he has started to feel more confident and we can tell he’s growing fond of the workers and building trust with them. It’s been a difficult and at times a stressful process, but they always make sure to let us know of all of the positive things he’s achieved that day.

A happy care giver will always have the enthusiasm to give their best so their passion towards helping kids reflects in their day to day work. My child gets to do a lot of activities here and most of the time returns happy 😃. If I start sharing the list of good things that has happened here probably will cross word limit. We are thankful to the educators for making potty training seamless. The total time taken was hardly a month since our child started going to the daycare. Ms. Sherry the current director is a very good manager and well aware of all the work that is going on under her supervision. Every staff probably feels the vibe and gives their best. We shall also be indebted to Ms. Vanessa, Ms. Angy, Ms. Brittany and Ms. Christina and everyone (I may not know the names of sorry) but who are involved from cleaning to preparing food and imparting fun filled play bases lessons and STEAM activities for all kids there. One other good thing to observe is that Edmonton’s weather is so unpredictable. However I feel relaxed to even know that the educators will have a perfect plan in mind to switch between outdoor and indoor activities for which touchwood very few children fall sick on a regular basis unlike other day cares we tried before. A BIG THANK YOU 🙏🏻 to all! Much love and respect ✊ please continue with your good work. Because it’s such a reliable support team depending on whom a parent can go to work with the inner confidence that their child won’t be neglected when they are not around to look after in person. Thanks 🙏🏻",

U would not even be able to drop in until later in the day if you able to get in . They just want full time attendance they can care less if you bringing ur child for part time . They would just give you the worst treatment .Same way they would treat ur part time kid in the day care not like others . Worst day care ever !",

The director Vanessa greeted me every morning and knows the children intimately.  All the staff knew our children well and took the time to care for them as individuals.\n\nOne improvement I would suggest is to get a communication app so that parents can follow along with their children throughout the day.\n\nMy children were always happy and excited to head to daycare and we really enjoyed our time there.

She really helped us with the process into daycare. My son still cries when I drop him off but he’s playing and happy when dad picks him up. And he seems to have gotten the hang of the routine at daycare. The staff are all very cheerful and knows the kids by names. I know he is well taken care of while we are at work. His teacher comforts him every morning when I drop him off to make him feel better. I’m so glad we decided on this daycare.\n\nIt’s a new daycare but I would highly recommend 👍🏻",

As parents with a very fast pace lifestyle we do worry where we leave our kids and here at Elwood I always felt great leaving her behind.

        "text": "I'd like to provide some feedback based on my experience in ENGL108 under the instruction of Safia Ahmad at MacEwan University. Initially, I found the course guidance somewhat ambiguous, as the assignments were issued without supporting rubrics. Despite my previous academic successes (a BBA Honours degree from NAIT with a GPA of 3.92 and a BSc degree with Distinction from UofA with a GPA of 3.7), I struggled to meet the grading criteria, which were not clearly articulated.\nDuring my entire academic journey, I have never previously encountered such low assignment grades without receiving appropriate explanation or constructive feedback. This led me to perceive a certain lack of clarity in Ms. Ahmad's communication with her students and a need for improvement in her organization skills.\nAdditionally, a series of quizzes we undertook were marred by various errors such as misspellings, incorrect answers, and issues with grammatical accuracy. I had to take the initiative to contact Ms. Ahmad on multiple occasions due to errors in the answer keys, which added an additional layer of frustration to my course experience.\nI regret to say that I found the response from MacEwan University to my concerns regarding academic competence, course content, and grading, less than satisfactory. As a result of these experiences, I felt compelled to withdraw from the ENGL108 course under Ms. Ahmad's \"teaching\". However, I subsequently completed the course with another instructor and was pleased to achieve an 'A' grade.\nIn light of my experience, I would urge MacEwan University to review their hiring processes, specifically when recruiting from countries beyond the G7, where verifying qualifications can be more challenging. This is not to question the skills or experience of educators from these regions, but merely to ensure that the university continues to maintain its high standards of Canadian education.",

An incident the Thursday before, i go to pick up my child from daycare, he and other children were playing in the halls. I go to grab his jacket from his locker, turn around and he is gone. He ran out the front door right in front of them and they insisted that he was still inside. While i wasted that 5-10minutes searching for him inside, he was outside on the street. I called daycare accreditation and they are going to investigate. I pulled my son out immediately. This is unacceptable. I have a few more complaints but the bottom line is \"this is the worst daycare my child has ever been in\". Watch your child and the staff very closely if you choose this daycare.

Everyday when we walk in to drop off or pick up our son all of the staff take the time to say hello/goodbye and engage with him (and us) which he loves. It makes us feel very welcome and comfortable.\n\nThe facility is huge and organized in a smart way. Very clean and open. Lots of variety of activities and toys for each age group. They take care of infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and before and after school care for older kids. They provide healthy kid friendly on meals and snacks.\n\nMy favorite part is the app they use to send me updates/information and photos throughout the day showing me their activities, his mood, what he is eating, etc. Also, a live camera to check in anytime while my son is there. It helps give me peace of mind that he is happy and having fun. Also, it's very interesting to get to see him interact with others when I am not there.",

To me, it is one of the most caring daycares with incredible and exceptional facilities in town. My daughter was here for 4 years. Even though she is in school now, she always relishes the memories of days she spent here. We are so contented with the services, environment and professionalism that I have enrolled my granddaughter too in this center. She is also very elated and joyful. I wish her to be here for years to come.\nThe center has all state-of-the-art facilities for indoor and outdoor activities including art & craft, multicultural, seasonal and recreational services for different age groups of kids. I am delighted to share that, among other amenities, halal food is also served and dietary preferences like allergies (if any) are also taken care of. Even in these critical times of pandemic, standard and quality of service has been maintained. Guidelines laid down by the Govt. of Alberta are followed with specialized care and regular thoughtfulness.\nThe director has qualities of head and heart. She is experienced, qualified and consummate in her proficient outlook and personality. Her behavior with staff, families and authorities is so inspiring and motivating that all team members of daycare vouch for it.\nI would highly recommend this place for those who are looking for comfortable and creative pastime for their children.",

When I went for a tour the Director ensured me, they followed all the health and safety protocols outlined by AHS. Starting a new Daycare and being exposed to so many new children and adults I was prepared for my son to catch a common cold or sickness. To my surprise and delight he has not been sick once. This confirms how clean and sanitized the center truly is. When I drop my son off in the morning he is always greeted by a warm and caring staff member. My son is always in good spirts and seems very happy and comfortable at the center. My son is a very picky eater and often refuses to eat. The staff and owner always make an effort to try and get him to eat. They have often given him ketchup or ranch so he can dip his food in (which for some reason he loves) or offer a different choice.

I was enthusiastically told there was space and to come in for an orientation.\n\nDuring orientation with the owner, I asked a few questions about childcare any concerned mother would ask. For example, I asked the infant teacher how she deals with children who cry during their first time in daycare. The owner said that it's good I ask these types of questions since many parents don't. Anyways, my husband and I liked the centre and left.\n\nWe then phoned that Friday to register. We were told to call again Monday morning, and I informed them that we would then bring our child for a couple hours as his first transition day. Monday morning (last week of Sep. 2017) I phoned at 6.30am to confirm we are coming and I get a call back at 7am from the owner that unfortunately there is no space as she has a director (whom she never told me about) that apparently booked and registered another infant without telling her. She said she'd call me back later in the day to see if she could re-arrange with the other parent as they also wanted part-time, so maybe we could do alternate days. She never phoned.\n\nMy husband and I found this entire situation odd, so he phoned the following day on Tuesday from his cell, inquiring if there was space available for a 14 month infant for the first week of October/right away. The owner answered enthusiastically that there was space and he could come and register his child right away as there were only 4 kids in the infant room. When I called half an hour later from my cell, asking if she has space, she answered that she is full...\n\nThe owner outright lied to my face. Why? Because I asked some questions? As a concerned parent and mother, I would urge every parent sending their child to THINK TWICE about sending your child to this daycare. To me it verifies the authenticity of multiple online reviews that state that children may be neglected and/or parents who show even a little concern are NOT WELCOME here.\n\nI am grateful that I did not enroll my child in this program and that I found out the nature and true colors of the owner and this centre.",

The kids are always treated with respect and taught all of the things you would want to - positive ways to resolve conflict, sharing, manners.

My son would be starting daycare as I returned to work from maternity leave but it was also the year we met one of the most caring providers around who quickly became family. Choosing someone to fill your role while you are gone, is not for the faint of heart. From the moment we met with Gurinder we knew our son would be in the best of hands. The amount of pure love and dedication to every child in her care was palpable. Not once did we ever have to worry while being away from him. He transitioned with her and her family as they ended their home based daycare and took over ownership of Future Stars Child Development Centre. Everyone at the daycare centre is wonderful. Plenty of opportunities for play, learning, cultural immersion, home cooked meals and reasonable rates! Our son has now transitioned out of their care into a new place in preparation for school next year. It was one of the hardest decisions we have had to make. I know how hard it is to entrust your child's life and wellbeing into the hands of others. You will not have anything to worry about here! We love you “Aunty Guri”!",

The program is a Reggio Emilia inspired and the teachers are skilled at designing a curriculum that inspires curiosity and fosters a greater understanding of key concepts. Our son joined the program during the pandemic in Sept of 2020, and has attended the Wonder Room and the Discovery Room. They managed to keep the students safe with increased hygiene protocols. With student's safety at the forefront, this program has created a successful and safe learning environment.\n\nI would highly recommend this program to anyone looking for an early learning centre for their child. They successfully integrate outdoor time and indoor learning centres - and the staff are very knowledgable and skilled in early education. They create a comfortable environment - and from the first day, our son entered the school - which was unknown to him and everyone was masked - he felt instantly comfortable. This is due to the warm and inviting nature of the team of teachers assembled. This program has a long history of serving the community.\n\nThe teachers work closely with the parents to provide a collaborative learning environment that is supported at home.",

        "text": "I wish I could add more stars here then 5, however there are not enough stars for me to rate such a wonderful place. Our daughter loved going to daycare, the hardest part for us was when we moved for my job and she had to change daycares. They treated her like family, she was well cared for and loved. As a first time parent I was extremely skeptical, hesitant, and overly protective. The owners (who are a husband and wife team), and their wonderful staff, put all my concerns to rest and I was able to drop my daughter off each day knowing she was in the best hands. The facility is clean, the food she had daily was delicious and filling, she made lots of friends, they had easy ways to contact them if you need to change something or if our child was going to be late (and she was all the time), they worked with us on our needs and recommendations of our pediatrician, and! she learned so much from the staff, her development was crazy! If you are looking for a daycare in the Edmonton area. This, this is the place you want to send your children, do not look anywhere else, its not worth your time. Close the other windows you have open with daycare options, and just contact Gilgal and set up an appointment. Seriously best choice you will make today.\n\nAlso they are genuine about their faith. As a Christian myself I wanted a Christian daycare for my daughter. I was happy to know they are Christian and live out those values in how they treat others.",

        "text": "Glenora Child Care Society has exceeded all my expectations.\n\nThe staff at GCCS are kind, loving, energetic, respectful teachers that bring excitement to my daughter's life, day after day. The classrooms are open, inviting and playful, and the outdoor space is constantly evolving and a highlight of the center. My daughter regularly eats lunches that I would pay top dollar at a restaurant for, all thanks to the in house chef, Noriko. And most importantly, the connection between the kids, teachers and fellow parents makes this center special.\n\nThe amount of outdoor play that the center fosters is unprecedented - at least 2 hours a day outdoors (weather permitting - though snow and coldness are usually only factors during season transitions, where some kids may not have all their gear yet -). Open ended and \"rough play\" are encouraged, under supervision, and children are often playing with friends of various age groups. Given the amount of cold weather in Edmonton, it would be remiss if a center did not have adequate strategies to deal with snow and negative degree temperatures. Last year, the center only had \"indoor days\" during the Polar Vortex and a select few other days. Most other days, the kids will be outdoors. It also encourages the family to explore the outdoors, since we know that the children are used to being outside. GCCS even loans out snowshoes during the wintertime to eager families.\n\nAfter speaking with the staff, I was also pleased to learn that they are happy to work at the center - well paid, benefits, overtime, fully staffed and with  excellent opportunities to improve their skill sets. Other parents I have spoken to have had several of their children go through GCCS and have been so happy with their experiences. After discussing with many friends, I have also discovered, happily, that GCCS rates are very reasonable given the caliber of the center.\n\nWhen my daughter was starting at the school, she was 18 months old - hesitant to take even the smallest set of steps - and constantly asking for the assistance of others to help her do tasks. At GCCS, she grew into a very brave, independent, thoughtful learner. She is 3.5 years old now, and can set the table, put away dishes, serves herself (usually healthy) snacks, and can dress herself with her winter coat and accessories. Best of all, she loves her friends and her teachers. Each day she has amusing stories to tell and with the App, I can usually prompt her to tell me more about her day.\n\nWhat an incredible environment for our daughter to learn how to be a part of a community of caring humans.",

        "text": "PLEASE BEWARE . I up until recently had two of my children attended this \"daycare\". Back story I had I my boys enrolled in the \"daycare\" for about 3.5 years. The first, 2ish years were great my kids were happy, staff around was consistent. Communication with the workers was great.\n\nThere seem to be a change in management roughly a year ago. That's were things took a turn for the worst. My youngest (4) son in that time became so unhappy and frustrated that he was \"lashing out\" at the center. So i tried to work together with the current manager to come up with a plan she her self said the daycare was not up to standard. To rectify the situation a plan was made and improvements seem to be happening, well was I ever wrong.\n\nThe constant staff change with no follow through on the plan (there part) my son began to slip again. This time around the manager would become extremely rude on the phone and in person. She would call ordering us to pick up are son. Which we complied with. She would send a video of my son crying very distraught and upset like a video that would break your heart if it was your child. The puzzling factor was my son would not act like this at home.\n\n3 days before I started back at school we recieved a termination letter from current manager. In hindsight it was the best/only good thing she did for my child.\n\nDigging a little deeper we found out through staff and other kids. That my son was being bullied. He was being constantly singled out by some of the workers calling him a bad boy, and the staff would Tell the other children. Do not play with him as he is a bad kid. This is basic BULLYING\n\nI was heartbroken I couldn't believe as a parent I failed my own child. I actually believed the manager (current). It turns out she did not have the best interest in my child. It made me sick to my stomach when I found all this out.\n\nThe number of infractions is actually incomprehensible. Some of the most basic things were violated. Having cleaning supplies under the toddler bathroom sink. Not enough staff supervision in rooms. You can actually look these up as they are available to the public.\n\nThankfully I have both my sons in a new daycare that actually cares for there well being. The amount of change in my youngest son since the new daycare is so much. I couldn't be happier. He is getting back to his old self finally.\n\nIt's funny how when we drive by the old daycare he gets scared, nervous and always ask me if he has to go to the old \"daycare\". I just turn to him and tell him he will never go back to that daycare. You can see how relieved he is when I tell him that.\n\nNow, I know that she will respond and try to slander my review that is just how they roll at this \"daycare\". But thats a bully mentality.\n\nSincerely Kyle",

You won’t be appreciated for your hard work as you should be working in a daycare. Also just to add, I worked at this centre for the duration of my education (almost a year) and there wasn’t a single toy replaced or any new toys. Kids get bored.",

They also updated me after each day regarding how his day went, what he had for lunch, etc. The rooms are spacious, bright and minimalist with a Montessori feel which I love as I believe it fosters imagination. Their arts and activities also foster imagination and recycled materials. I appreciate that they take the kids outside for fresh air whenever the weather allows. It's also nice to be greeted by the co-directors at the front daily.

She also didn’t communicate with her staff that I was coming so when I show up at the daycare for the orientation at 11am, no one was aware I was even suppose to be coming.\nWhile I’m sitting in the room at lunch time asking questions and getting to know the staff and helping my daughter build some synergy with Children and get to know the facility before I decide to just leave her there.\nThe teacher who will to be watching my child brings her cell phone to me and says her boss wants to talk to me.\nI am then told I can’t not stay at the daycare and I have to leave the daycare because of confidentiality. I didn’t understand why when I was trying to get my daughter familiar with the daycare. The director told me I wasn’t allowed to stay in the room with my daughter for longer the 10 minutes. I mentioned I have visited other daycares as well to get an idea of the program and not one of them has sent me away based off these policies. She then told me I should go with one of those other daycares then. I thought that was pretty rude and the whole experience was a waste of time and yes, potentially a break of confidentiality or whatever she stated because yah, I am being turned away and unwelcome there.\n\nBased off the poor communication and disrespect that was given there I won’t be enrolling my daughter.",

They could be a little more professional with some of their paperwork (when I dropped off my deposit I did not get a receipt or anything and remember my name & number was written on a little piece of paper which made me a little nervous but they did hold our spot and everything turned out fine) but no place is perfect and I did not come across anything that was poorly done (from what I've seen anyway!) I do wish they had a website where they posted pictures and updates (private access to parents), but I get most of my feedback from the staff in my daughter's room anyway and they give me a daily report of how she did for the day when I pick her up (verbal, nothing written). I also wish they gave the parents a weekly menu of the meals they eat, I haven't asked for one so maybe I should!\nThe place itself is an older building but clean and the rooms have lots of natural light and kept tidy (again, I've dropped in at different times during the day). My daughter's been happy there and safe.",

Yes, the owners are a bit high and mighty, and by the way they are Romainian, not \"polish or russian\". However, the staff are lovely. They sincerely care about the children, and enjoy spending time with them. It is a safe and loving environment. The owners invest time and money to add special activities (music lessons, field trips, etc), that are above and beyond what is required of them. And they have the most wonderful cook who prepares meals from scratch daily. No daycare is perfect, but this a darn good one. And yes, please do check...they are accredited.",

I met with one owner (Irna I think) and spoke with the other, they did seem to have that holier than tho persona. They discussed previous clients.... parents whose children previously went there-believing they were the ones that wrote these reviews- they discussed personal issues involving the children of these parents.\n\nAnd there are some serious complaints against the daycare with licensing as reported.\nAs nice as the staff is and as good as the food smelt that day .....I would not want to deal with those ladies! Oh - they also own Mount pleasant....which they didnt tell me I found out on my own when calling around. Too bad the rooms were bright and the rest of the staff was very nice!",

They employ such warm and welcoming staff, that I never hesitated leaving her in their care. Truly, they became her second  family, and I felt so relaxed knowing she was people that would care for her with such love and kindness. Sheri and Hans deserve a special mention, as my daughter spent over a year in the preschool room with them. They engage the kids, encourage them, and were great teachers of empathy and kindness.  We were so sad to say good bye, and even still my daughter talks fondly of them.\n\nHelping Hands has a great outdoor play space. I welcomed how messy my daughter would come home, knowing she was playing in and exploring the outdoor space. The indoor space was always clean and well maintained.\n\nWe felt so lucky we found Helping Hands and can’t recommend it enough!",

The outdoor space is like none I have ever seen at a daycare- it is a full park with trees, a garden, play-sets, and lots of toys for the kids to enjoy. My little one never wants to leave when I pick him up from the park!  They let them play and get a little dirty outside… like kids should :).  Through the summer they also made weekly trips to a nearby spray park.\nWe made the mistake of attempting switching daycares to one slightly closer to home for the convenience, but we were back at Helping Hands after a week! We quickly realized just how amazing the care he was receiving at Helping Hands was, and we were wrong to assume it’d be the same at another daycare.\nThe owners obviously do a great job with hiring as the teachers are all fantastic, and there has been very little turnover in their staff.\nI would recommend Helping Hands to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, laid back, and home-like experience for their children, with the security and reliability of an accredited daycare.\nProvided meals are coming back soon too…woohoo!",

We noticed some toddlers (no older than 2/3) walking across the parking lot, unaccompanied. There were two of them and they were walking straight towards 62 street, obviously intent on running into the road. We stopped them when they got to the sidewalk and asked where their mommies were. They couldn’t talk very well yet, but we heard some kids playing in the playground behind the daycare. So we picked them up and carried them back. The caretakers there hadn’t even noticed these two little boys were missing. We returned them safely back.\n\nI posted about this situation on Facebook because I felt this daycare would not report this incident to parents. I was right. The mother of one of these boys contacted me and informed me that they didn’t tell her what had happened. The day care then informed parents AFTER my Facebook post. They also stated they felt they didn’t need to report this to licensing.\n\nIf they are willing to hide this big of an incident, what else are they willing to hide?",

My kids’ agency is respected, they are confident, and never want to leave (which is my only complaint). There’s a big gym to play in on miserable days and a huge play park and field on the better ones, not to mention a food program.\n\nWe looked at way more than a few daycare options and this one blew us away. Walking in, the atmosphere is so welcoming, there is art, so many cultures are represented in each room and the hallways and all the materials and toys are as natural as possible.\n\nWhat an outstanding program (and educators!!!) that goes above and beyond, building confidence and character in our next generation. Our family is so fortunate to have gotten a call, I suggest adding your name to the wait list as soon as possible.",

There are 9 babies to 2 overwhelmed staff in the Infant/Toddler room.\n\nOne day, I went to pick my child and met only one staff left of the two; she couldn't be bothered to pacify the crying babies. Rather, she was busy sorting the trash and taking out a garbage bag.\n\nA particular baby cried so much that she was red in the face and tired. She would sit up in the crib, cry, fall back into the crib and roll over in blankets from head to toe on a hot afternoon. No one comforted her. It was so heartbreaking to watch as a mom myself.\n\nI withdrew my child the next day!",

As this was our first daycare experience, we greatly appreciated the patience and attentiveness from the staff at Kepler. Teacher Mary Jane in particular was very responsive to emails in our first few weeks at Kepler and did a great job at helping us transition to having our son at daycare. He talks about his teachers often and now can't wait to see them each morning!",

Maryjane, the facility's director, has always had great communication and that has really helped build a strong foundation of trust.\nDaycare is such a monumental and incredible journey for our little one, we had our reservations about this big change in our child's life, however it has become very clear that even after a short period of time, our child has already learned so much. Kepler incorporates a wide variety of activities that really speak to the children, it is so fun to watch what they discover. I really appreciate that they provide meals for our child; their onsite cook prepares delicious snacks and meals throughout the day.\nMy child's teachers Afsana, Buddhika and Kate have been caring, patient and kind- they are incredible and we couldn't ask for anything more. I am fortunate to have found a facility that meets the needs of my child and puts their growth at the forefront of their curriculum.\nI recommed this team to any parent looking for the best care available.",

Programming looks great etc etc. That's what the 2 stars are for. The problem I have was the admin and follow up. After sending in some questions after the tour via email, they were promptly answered and it was communicated a registration package will be sent our way. When the registration is completed, a welcome package will then be forwarded. We were excited that we had an opportunity at our first pick facility. So, we stopped searching and declined other opportunities that contacted us as we didn't want to hold up spots for other parents waitlisted at those other places. I guess that's where our mistake was made, we put all our eggs in one basket. We never received a registration package from Kepler, even after following up and are now searching, again, for quality child care. Good times. It's been a few weeks since any communication or reply.  What's the point of having your customer service rep and client experience lead cc'd on the email communications only to be ghosted? At least one of you have the professionalism to email back whatever the issue was. Isn't that the point of your roles, to follow up on the experience or service that is being rendered? I've gone back and forth about posting this review. However, I'm also in a high level admin role and know how these processes work and this is just terrible. Just poor consideration of a family's time and effort looking for child care when it's already not easy to do.",

        "text": "Parents Beware- Fraudulent Activity\n---\n\nI enrolled my three children at Kepler Academy at Sunlife Place from January 2022 to August 2022. Unfortunately, our experience was marred by several significant issues.\n\nTo begin with, we were quoted a monthly fee of $1,700 after grants. However, during the first three months, we were charged over $3,500 per month, totaling a staggering $10,500 for that period. The lack of communication and clarity regarding this discrepancy was deeply concerning. Attempts to seek clarification from the director only led to conflicting and unclear explanations.\n\nThe problem persisted for nearly six months before the charges were finally resolved. Even obtaining statements of costs for tax purposes became a protracted four-month ordeal, extending into April 2023.\n\nThe breaking point that prompted me to write this review occurred in August 2023, more than a year after my children attended the school, when I received an unexpected charge of $200 from Kepler Academy. My wife made multiple attempts to contact the director through email, phone calls, and text messages, all of which were marked as read, but received no response for over 30 days.\n\nI visited the academy in person to resolve the issue. To my disbelief, the director attempted to deflect responsibility and claimed that our billing team had contacted my wife. However, she couldn't provide a clear reason why, after 12 months of service, our account was being charged. There had been no prior email notifications, physical mail, phone calls, or any indication of an outstanding bill.\n\nWhen I requested a point of contact in the billing department, I was met with refusal, as the director stated she couldn't provide that information and insisted that I contact her directly.\n\nRegrettably, I am now compelled to involve my bank and initiate a fraud investigation against a company that I had initially considered reputable.\n\nThis experience has been characterized by a lack of transparency, poor communication, and unexplained charges, leaving me deeply dissatisfied with Kepler Academy.\n\n——\nUpdate Sep 14 2023\n\nWe have yet to receive any communication in the form of a statement or invoice that clarifies the rationale behind a $200 charge, which was incurred over a year after our departure from your service.\n\nIt is disconcerting that it took a public post to prompt any response to our inquiries. Even following that, neither the Centre Director nor the Finance Department has taken the initiative to reach out and address this matter.\n\nIt is essential to highlight that withdrawing funds without notice or authorization, especially one year after the termination of a service agreement, is a practice that lacks transparency and professionalism. Had there been an outstanding balance in our account due to an audit, we should have been promptly informed and provided with a statement.\n\nWe are at a loss as to why our account would carry a balance, as we consistently adhered to timely fee payments and provided over two months' notice upon our departure from the facility. It is not our responsibility if the Finance and Billing department encounters difficulties in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of parent account fees and subsidies.\n\nMoreover, in addition to these unauthorized withdrawals, the Centre Director's refusal to acknowledge our numerous calls, emails, text messages, and in-person inquiries has further exacerbated this situation.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we formally request the immediate return of the funds in question.",

The first few days she cried a little, but Eleni and Sukhleen are amazing teachers, they are very loving, have lots of patience and made this transition much easier for us. The centre director, Sunita, is very attentive and dedicated to the centre. She also makes sure to know every child and family that attend Kepler. Actually, within a week, almost everyone knew who my daughter and I were. I felt I was welcomed into a family. Sheila, is always smiling and welcoming us when we get to the centre. I feel safe when I talk her as she is always reassuring me that my children are doing well (you know how this transition can be harder on parents than on the children!). The food menu is diverse and rich in fruits and vegetables, so I don’t have to worry whether my daughter is eating healthy while there. Actually, we get daily updates on what and how much our children eat (plus a picture of an activity!). The activities are well thought out and appropriate for children age and development. My daughter developed a lot since she started at Kepler, in all aspects, cognitively, physically, socially, and emotionally. She didn't speak English at all, now she cannot wait to say \"hello\" to people on the street and talk to them. My son (18-month old) is also attending Kepler now, he started in July. I cannot say enough how much I appreciate his teacher, Sujata. After a few weeks he would go to her without crying. She gave him lots of attention and love, she is always smiling, kind, and has the best humor. She is on top of everything and very approachable, making my life way easier when I drop and pick up my son. I am so lucky to have both my children attending a great centre! They have many more great people there. Teacher Happy and teacher Veronica are sometimes in charge of my children and they are so lovely and caring too. I have a feeling they like what they do and are happy in their professions. What else could I mother ask for?",

Our son has learned so many new skills and gets to do so many fun activities throughout the day!  I would recommend Kepler to anyone and everyone!\n\nThank you again Anu, Alisha and Sita!

Kepler has been so good for her in expanding her social skills, her alphabet and numbers, and just all around knowledge. She has just turned 3 and knows more than a kindergarten aged child. Rhrizlane, Chona, and Maria have been paramount to her learning, and her Comfort there. Kris, the chef is awesome too!!! It smells so good when we come in and we know there are amazing healthy meals prepared for our child there everyday. We are so thankful we have this facility to care for our child. They're an incredible team and I am so glad we she has a place there. ❤️ thank you Kepler or being so kind to our baby girl. You are like family to us and we wouldn't trust anyone else with our baby.",

My son is 3 years old and this is his first experience with daycare. His Educators Ritika and Jory have been very good to him. I can see they really do care about him. Ritika is always smiling and so happy to see my son, greeting him excitedly. Jory seems to have a very special bond with him and some of the other kids, she is great at comforting them. My son will often fall asleep on Jory at nap time when he has been upset. She has a calming and caring nature about her.",

Things started great but we soon realized that the turnover at that place was out of this world. I often went to pick up my child and she was alone in the window waiting for me. Too many kids, not enough educators to take care of them. They kept telling us that they were short staff... Ever since we moved our child to a different daycare, we've notice a huge difference in our child's development and happiness. Fun fact, when I asked the last daycare director (had 3 come through in 15 months) if she was curious to know why I was pulling my kid out of there, she simply told me no... and that just validated even more my decision to move away from that Kepler Academy location.",

Kids & Company was our obvious choice — the director and teachers put our worries at ease. They even let us do a free trial to make sure it was a good fit for our one-year-old son before we registered. They let the daycare do the talking instead of just telling us what we wanted to hear. We were so happily surprised by the attention and care given to our son, who is quite sensitive. We get face-to-face updates at the end of the day as well as throughout. They really care about letting us know how our son is doing and making sure we’re happy with how they’re handling his care. Our little guy loves playing with his new friends and has a blast every day! Can’t recommend this centre enough.",

My boys have been attending since 2017 and we could not be happier. The staff turnover is very low,  the leadership team is clearly strong, everyone is responsive to your needs as a parent and your children's. Love the ability to log on anytime to take a peek at what kids are up to, the food, the fact that it isn't one big open space but rooms are divided by actual walls. You receive reports throughout the day about activities, sleep time, potty times etc. The fact that the parking is underground and K&Company have reserved spots (free) for pick up and drop off is a real perk - especially in the winter.\n\nThe staff are like family for my kids and we will certainly miss them all when my kids go to full time school. I will say it is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for. I would not hesitate in recommending this place to family and friends.",

I enroll my kids in this daycare because was on front of the school.\nThis was July 2019, Chloe, the director email me the prices and how much it will be starting on September after the yearly price adjustment and summer break time. On September, the amount withdraw from my account was higher that agreed so I asked what happened. By that time, the director was Tam and she asked me for the emails.\nI sent all the emails exchanged with Chloe stating the price and she reply that was a mistake from the previous director and accounting agreed to do a 1 time discount, but they couldn't respect the price given.\nWell, on December 3rd I was notified at 7pm by Jackie Winter, Senior Are Manager that the center will close on December 13th and they will transfer all the kids to a different one, 20 min away from that one. A daycare that has been running for 20+ years, no caring for the problems this would carry.\nAs there are no other daycares that work with my kids school, we agreed.\nOn January 30 I gave my 1 month notice to take my kids to somewhere else as the distance is killing our days. Next day we receive a call asking what they could do for us to keep the kids in the center, that they could offer us a great discount, but honestly, the distance is stronger than the money, so we refuse.\n2 days later, Jackie email me saying I'm owning them money the Subsidy didn't cover in October.\nI not even have subsidy...I forwarded her all the emails of why I do got a one time discount and she never replies.\nNow my kids are somewhere else, I'm receiving emails trying to charge me this mystery amounts.\nI tried to call the main office in Ontario and no one answer ever, the current site director (because no one seem to last over 3 months) said she want me to send all the emails again.\n\nPlease avoid the headache, this franchise is so poorly managed and they close the daycare no caring for the effect on the kids or parents.\nMy friend in BC had the same situation, they close a center from one day to another.",

I told them i was teaching my kid privacy and she needs to close the door and the manager said she will come with a solution by the end of the week but nothing has been done. Also most of the time my daughter came home starving. I was bringing food with me so she can eat some in car. And when i mentioned this they said they cant force kids to eat. And one day her lips were so dry and i asked didnt she have any water? And she said she asked for it but she couldn't get and I checked with teacher and she said there was a construction in the building so they couldnt use the waters. So my poor kid couldnt drink a sip of water all day and she was dehydrated.It is the worst worst worst daycare/ school i've ever seen.\nOnly good thing teacher Rose is nice.",

We brought them up to the director and she was FANTASTIC. She took our concerns very seriously and acted immediately on them to correct them. She also kept me informed throughout the process.\nWe also brought a concern up to the assistant director about the angle of the camera and how we couldn't see a corner of the classroom very well. She immediately looked at it and corrected it while I was there.\nNow what we see is fantastic staff engaging with my daughter and the children in her classroom.\nI used to be worried as a first time mom leaving my daughter in the hands of strangers as I didn't know what level of care she would receive but I do not worry anymore. I know she is in GREAT hands. It shows by the enthusiasm my daughter has when she comes to this place.\nMy daughter used to cling to me and cry when I tried to pass her off to the teacher, because it was a new experience for her, but now she almost jumps out of my arms to go to the teacher, Joy or Claudia when I drop her off! She sometimes even waves goodbye to me, which makes me very happy to see she is comfortable with the ladies there!\nYou can tell all of the staff love the children that go there, that its not just a job to them. The staff know all the childrens names as they pass in the hall, whether they are in the same classroom or not.\nWe are even buying a house in the same area (even though we wanted to go further south) so that we didn't have to find a new daycare.\nI highly recommend this daycare!!",

My oldest used to come here during the weekends and she loved it so much. You can tell that all the teachers really love kids, truly caring and inspiring. The owner is very friendly and cares about the staff. Each room is quite spacious. If I were to give any critical feedback I'd say if the baby room could be a bit cleaner, not that it's a concern just improvement.",

My little one started going at the age of 18 months and now he is 3 years old. Never had any concerns or issues. Always felt like I am sending my little one to his another family where all the staff work very hard and take care of kids so much. My son love to go there everyday and I had to wait for him when I pick him up as he doesn’t wanted to leave his daycare and love to play there. Recently we moved to a different place and that was the only reason I had to change the daycare. Otherwise I would have never changed as he was so much used to and love his teachers. He still says his teachers name at home. Thank you to everyone for taking care of my little one. Special thanks to Sohaila, Avneet and Harleen for your hard work and love towards the kids.",

        "text": "My daughter has been going going to Kinder Campus for nearly two years now. Our original goal had been to find something a bit closer to home once we moved to the south side (it's a 45 min commute every morning), but that simply isn't an option anymore. The reasons are numerous, but it really boils down to the fact that while many daycares and dayhomes portray themselves as having a family environment, Kinder Campus is the family that we want our family to be.\n\nThe staff are not just caring - they are passionate about creating the safest, most nourishing space possible for every child in their care. From private, personalized blog posts about our daughter that are almost mini novels in length to stacks of art projects every month to things like \"international mud day\" and \"Batman day\", I firmly believe that no one else would be able to care for my daughter the way that this daycare has - even myself.\n\nI guess I'm writing this review now because when we were looking around for prospective daycares, I must admit that Kinder Campus was not even on my radar. There are many daycares in Edmonton after all, and as I tend to shop for products and services via reviews, I didn't even notice this one. However, my wife had heard great things from two of her friends, and ended up spending half a day at the daycare just observing the staff's interaction with our daughter and the other children. She had done the same vetting process with multiple other daycares by this point, and she immediately knew that Kinder Campus was the one. Now, after having the pleasure of interacting nearly daily with Hanne, Debra, Danielle, Jezelle and all the other great people at Kinder Campus for the past couple of years, I can't imagine trusting my daughter with anyone else. So if any prospective parents happen upon this review, do your child a favor and take the time to personally visit Kinder Campus and compare with the other daycares. You won't regret it!",

During their time at LaPetite, my children were extremely content - always happy to go to daycare each day, excited to see their friends and teachers, and always coming home with crafts, fun stories of adventures, new songs and french words! I loved the innovative use of their HiMama app, which provided updates throughout the day in the form of photos and staff communication.\nI trusted the staff at LaPetite so completely, and always felt very confident my children were in good hands.

They always lied about what happen probably because they never paid attention. My daughters only attended this daycare 2 months. I pulled them out because I had picked up my daughter and noticed a huge gash on my daughters forehead. I completely seen red! On their incident report it says it’s a scratch which I got confirmation from a doctor that it was in fact a wound and not a scratch. My older daughter said she was pushed and hit her head and blood was pouring from her head. I asked the daycare why her jacket she wore to daycare was wet and they said “she threw it in the water” turns out they were attempting to wash the blood out of her jacket. They did so basic first aid and my partner nor myself was notified. On the report says it happened at 2:30 we picked her up at 5:45pm. HER PARENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD!!! Incompetent people watching other peoples kids. I am amazed people are trusting them with their children. They will allow anyone to be a daycare worker these days. If I could post pictures I would of all the evidence I have of this horrible daycare!",

As a mother and a psychologist with over 15 years of experience (which includes advanced training at the University of Alberta, a competitive and accredited program) I would highly recommend this daycare. Our experience with teacher Rebecca was more than we could ask for. Our daughter is a strong willed and sensitive child, and it can take a lot of time for her to warm up to someone. She immediately established a bond with Rebecca. She is no longer in that classroom, and she will tell us every week she wants to be in teacher Rebecca room. Over the years I observed Rebecca create a safe space (physical and emotional), while also developing an age appropriate curriculum. My child has learned so much from Rebecca and we are grateful for that. Recently there have been some concerning reviews about Rebecca that are not consistent with my experience or the other parents I have talked to. Professionally speaking, I disagree that this daycare would lead to childhood trauma. This is a reputable daycare with over ten years of the same management. This daycare has seen repeat customers and many families find their way there through word of mouth. Finding a child care provider is one of the biggest decisions you will make as a parent. I hope in addition to looking at online reviews, you will talk to the owner, staff and other parents when making this decision. I would be happy to talk to anyone that is curious about this business from a parent perspective but also a child development perspective.",

Would not recommend if your child is full of energy. My son got sick lots of times, outbreaks of lice and came home with a full diaper and dirty hands and face. Not a good experience for my family. Also they admitted to locking my son in a stroller because they were unable to watch him. Why label your daycare as one that helps kids on the spectrum and say you can accept my children then kick them out. While I’m at work, going home making supper and cleaning up. My son was at the daycare being locked up in stroller. I will have trust issues after this and not trust anyone with my children again.",

JOLLY RANCHERS!! Overall sour attitude from everyone and terrible environment to have your children in this school. 0/10 do not recommend this school for your kids mental health and education towards their future.

His lack of understanding, compassion and desire to learn what works best for individual children learning needs and abilities is just not there. Numerous parent teacher conversations and zero results towards change. \"Beating a dead horse.\" All my children started at Laurier Heights from kindergarten in the French Immersion program and the bullying was prominent. Issues were never appropriately handled and swept under the rug. We chose to have our one child transfer from Laurier Heights in grade 7 do to constant bullying (causing mental health struggles) and a HUGE lack of option classes. Understand- there is NO technology class, a multi purpose library, NO construction and fabrication, NO cosmetology, NO costume design and the foods class that Laurier Heights does offer is very small and limits the kids ability to excel. I strongly encourage you to reconsider this school, there is a VERY good reason why their reviews are this low!",

We put my daughter in another daycare before that but within a week, we pulled her out and then I came across Learned Robin Montessori. Fast forward to 3 1/2 years later and still counting; both of my girls go to LRM and we have never had an issue with the way the daycare is run. The staff is really compassionate and patient towards the kids, Razia has a natural nurturing and motherly personality. She knows details about each child and she treats everyone like one big happy family.\nRecently I took my youngest daughter who just turned 3 for a preschool program screening and she didn't qualify because she was well above the developmental scale. This just assured me that LRM not only does an amazing job with caring for my children, but they also do a thorough job with teaching my kids. My eldest will be starting kinder in the fall but we plan to keep her there for after school care as well.\nBring your kids here!! You will not be disappointed at all.",

        "text": "PART 2:  .... I don't need to defend myself or go into any more details, but this response is EXACTLY another reason why my children no longer attend this daycare.  3 years was enough to try and work it out and improve things.\nSimply unprofessional,\n\nI am very disappointed with Learning Hands Daycare. Rather than console or talk to a child who is having a difficult time, they take their phones out and start recording them which is enough to make anyone angrier. Nothing can justify them to record a child for this reason, I did not consent to that. This happened on many occasions and more than 1 child.  They also threatened me that moving forward, I would have to pick up my child in the middle of the day because they could not handle them around nap time as they don't have enough staff to separate kids who sleep, away from older kids who don't. By threatening me to pick them up, they are no longer guaranteeing me or providing the care that I paid them for.\nLearning Hands Daycare is extremely unprofessional. They do not take any accountability. Look at any of the negative reviews and you will see they are always redirecting issues and blame to the families who have concerns.\nI would NEVER send a child or recommend this place.",

The staff engage the children in a variety of activities that build their\nskills and excitment of the world around them. They also promote a warm social interaction between the kids that is more of a family environment. Again great daycare!🙂",

Of the fourth daycare our kids have attended they enjoy this one the most. Staff is involved and our kids have even come home showing us how to play 2 different card games. This is invaluable as far as I’m concerned. The only downfall may be location, and I believe the playground is less than impressive, but a minor inconvenience IMO. I’m comfortable sending my kids here.",

As a childcare professional, I have completed childcare level 2, WHMIS, and safety training.

I started getting really upset after every single day it was a new problem, and I was made to feel like it was my fault. I am at work and putting my trust in staff to keep my kids safe amd know what to do. They are kids who need a little extra help, but unfortunately the daycare just doesn't understand that. I ended up leaving my job and pulling my kids out of this daycare and won't be recommending them.",

They have a large indoor gym which I love because I know he still gets the opportunity to run around and play on equipment even when its too cold or wet outside. I highly recommend this daycare.",

My son had four new room teachers in five months. This was especially difficult for him since he was potty training. The last teacher he had (Jess) was a lovely and dedicated teacher but was ultimately set up to fail by the managers by pairing her with many different assistants who were not up to the task of teaching or associating busy toddlers.\nWe ended up having to find another daycare when my husband showed up to drop our son off on September 3rd and did not know any of the child care providers in my son's room. We were later told by management that his teacher was burnt out and moved to a different room and that the teacher should have told us that she was moving. It was not uncommon for the teachers to look absolutely exhausted at the end of the day.\nJess, did everything should could to help our son transition to potty train at daycare but it was not a success.\nMy husband and I were no longer comfortable leaving our son there with such a high turnover of staff. Our September fees were taken out of our account that day and were never returned.",

It is my first experience with a day care, after looking at many and I am so glad that this is where we went with! in the infant room they pay close attention to details, they make sure that the kids are well looked after and most importantly loved! In the first few weeks they made sure that I felt confident in leaving my infant in their care.\n\nin the preschool room they are always doing some type of activity, free play, movement and learning exploration. they are excellent at dealing with the conflict that arises with these young minds.\n\nin both rooms I have been impressed with the communication as well as their responsiveness to any questions I have. Both of my kids enjoy the meals that are provided. I also appreciate that they post daily plans so that I can discuss with the kids what they did that day. they are very up-to-date and in the know about licensing and are careful to follow safety and cleaning practices.\n\nI would highly recommend little learning house to anyone looking for a daycare for their child!",

I am pleased with the little staff turn over as there are some “original” staff from when we started. The location is excellent with easy access to parking which makes drop off quick and easy. For being downtown the monthly fee is very reasonable. Security is great as you need a scan card. The facility is brightly painted and has a wonderful outdoor play area for being downtown, that was one of the main attractions for me as a parent. Recently, I’ve asked staff to not let my daughter sleep at nap time due to difficulty putting her down at bedtime. They seem to be following my directions which I am pleased with. My daughter has developed and learned so much in her 3 years at this daycare which will definitely prepare her for kindergarten!\n\nI would recommend this daycare to other parents.",

All the teachers are very loving, caring, pay attention to a child’s need and groom their individual personality. They provide good food and accommodate for any allergies. My daughter learned a lot, made some good friends and lifelong great memories. Every day, my daughter was happy to meet her teachers, do crafts and play with her friends. My daughter did fun projects throughout the year about different cultural events. She enjoys her kindergarten now but still misses everyone at her daycare and asks me to take her there. I would like to thank Ajay and all the teachers to take such good care of my daughter. I would highly recommend this daycare to all the parents.",

Recognizing difficulties and challenges and really helping them overcome them with kindness and compassion. The boys made lots of friends, always had fun activities and learned so much. They were always happy to go and sad to leave. Our last day was filled with emotions both excited for a new chapter and sad to leave such a loving, fun environment.

We found out that we would be in Edmonton for several months while we awaited the birth of our second child. Mama Roza's was recommended to us by a nurse at the RAH and I went to meet with Esta (Mama Roza's daughter) and immediately fell in love with the space and the compassion shown to me and my family. Not only were they extremely understanding and accommodating, they have created a wonderful community and familial atmosphere of caring and respect (a quick message out to the community and they helped me get a playpen for my daughter so she had somewhere to sleep at oir AirBnB). My daughter absolutely loves the daycare, which is incredible, themed curriculum that is shared with parents in advance that includes experiential learning amd STEM activities (which as an educator is a huge plus in my books) and freshly prepared healthy meals and snacks daily by their in-house chef. Every one of their staff I have interacted with are both knowledgeable and professional (Huge thank you to Esta and Ruth for going above and beyond to support us) and treat my daughter as their own. If you are in Edmonton and are looking for childcare or know someone who is, I highly recommend Mama Roza's. Thank you for being so amazing.\nMichael Small",

        "text": "This review is for the south side location. I’ve had the pleasure of sending 2 of my children from 12 months old all the way through to OSC care up to grade 3 and pre-school. I made a surprise visit when first considering this daycare and they served healthy veggie snacks and the director was also hands on & they gladly gave me the grand tour. I was lucky there was no waiting list at the time either. Their pricing is competitive and, I dare say more affordable than some others. They were excellent at offering tips on how to reduce separation anxiety at drop offs when we first started and as my kids developed, they had communication sheets/ books so I could read on the progress and they posted photos on the walls so I didn’t feel like I was missing out ( I work full time). They staff are great at communication and were always quick to call if my child was ill or if an incident happened with another child, their follow up processes are excellent. They post everything too, everything from audits, fire drill results, if there was COVID exposures (rare), first aid qualified staff, resources for parents, and even what the daily menus are for the kids (I really appreciated how they served healthy meals and hot lunches). Their programs offerings are excellent and included other fun things like kid yoga, and even Zumba at one point. They’ve had community guest speakers like police and firemen, and even did neighborhood field trips to the seniors centre & the grocery store pre-pandemic and did Halloween trick or treating with the shops on the same strip mall. They also do outdoor walks, trips to the playground and even silver berry park/playground sometimes. Their teaching programs in general are fantastic, my youngest learned the names of continents through song at age 4 and the special days like teddy bear picnics, or multicultural days are fun & taught my kids about ethnic traditions re: my eldest had learned a Punjabi kids rhyme (we’re not Punjabi), and they learned about Diwali, Chinese New Year, etc. We opted for the summer camp preschool program this year while my youngest transitioned to a new daycare within the school she’s starting at this fall and MMSSCDC did direct pick up & drop off with her for their day amp program. I feel like this daycare has been like a second parent to my children and they have raised them so well. It’s a little bittersweet having to leave, we just found it more convenient for a direct drop off and pick up at their school for OSC who are open just a little bit earlier and closed later, even though I feel the service is not up to par and not as good a value compared to MMSSCDC (now called scholastic). If and when I have another child, MMSSCDC will definitely be the top choice for daycare in my books!!",

Sharon and Lucy do an amazing job taking care of my daughter. She  is always happy to see them when she comes to daycare.",

My oldest started out very anxious, but Sharon in particular went out of her way to help him settle in and devoted time every day to connecting with him and soothing his fears. Reena and Lila were wonderful teachers to him and he still asks to have play dates with them! My little guy loved his teachers in the Ruby room and would always say \"Yes!\" when I asked if he wanted to go see Paula and Sonija. The lunches were great and both our kids spent lots of time socializing and making friends that we still meet up with. We miss the center very much. Thank you Masterminds!",

Our son started when he was 6 months old from infant room and has moved up to the toddler room recently.\n\nIt is not easy to leave your child at daycare for the first time, especially when they are so young, but soon enough we got peace of mind that he was receiving the best care.\n\nAll of the educators have been so lovely with him, and so enthusiastic to see him every morning. I love how MCE childcare is so proactive about planning thoughtful and educational activities every day, and I also love how they provide such a healthy well-balanced menu for lunches and snacks.\n\nYes, there is always room for improvement but they are so dedicated to improve proactively. Especially the Director Benazir is impeccably hard-working and passionate about this childcare. The director is an exceptional lead and a true asset to our community. She brought together some amazing teachers who are so caring and welcoming.\n\nWe’re overwhelmed with the level of care, professionalism and quality of early learning the MCE Childcare team provides.",

They keep checking your kids development regularly. They are always open to answering our questions and addressing any concerns promptly. The staff is caring, attentive, and truly dedicated to the well-being and development of the children in their care. They provide the report by the end of the day.

They don't answer their phones or respond to voicemails, they do not respond to emails, facebook messages... The one time I managed to call and actually get through to a person, there was no professional greeting or \"thank you for calling McLeod Day Care\" just a \"hello?\"\n\nAny parent who is concerned for their child's wellbeing would probably find it distasteful how bad at communication this facility is. If I have to buy, train and employ a carrier pigeon to get in contact with this facility, then you probably aren't a good place to put a small child.\n\nEither way, I was very disappointed, as were other parents I had talked to who had similar experiences.

Extremely clean, they regularly have him in his spare outfit at the end of the day when I pick him up so he's presentable I stead of dirty if we have to stop anywhere before going hope. So very happy with my decision which was a difficult one to make to leave him with someone full time.",

The amount of times i was assaulted at that daycare is far more than i can count anymore, and not once did they ever help me out. The old supervisor used to act really nice to me, but then say the worst thing to my parents, then this new guy named ronny started running the daycare and he was just all around a terrible person. I cant remember a day where I didnt have an extreme migraine, and they wouldnt let me sleep on the extremely worn down couch to deal with it, I had to sleep on the tiles in a corner next to the radiator that never actually kept me warm, because of this daycare I learned how to sleep on hard surfaces comfortably. If you actually respect your kids, dont bring them here, put them in moms choice daycare in lymburn, thats where I went after going here when I moved, its far better and the teachers there are actually respectable people",

I do not feel as if they are equipped to deal with children. An autistic child is still a child.

Me and my wife had been looking for a daycare for our little one for almost over a month around north side of edmonton. We looked at couple of places  around and we where not happy with most of them until we came across this daycare. Helen, the owner and director of  Moms dream daycare took her time to explain and showed us around. She walked us through their amazing program plan for the children. During the tour, the kids kept on coming up to her and the staff members for a random hugs. We could tell how passionate Helen and the workers were. The interaction was unbelievable. The children seemed very happy. It wasn't easy finding the right daycare for our boy ,but now we can finally say we found the right place. Our son loves the daycare from the moment we went to see it, he didn't want to leave the daycare when we went the first time to see it. All I want to say is, Thank you Helen what an amazing place you created for these children, keep up the good work !",

The staff also a ensure that children have ample physical play and they provide the children with a variety of activities such a dance, yoga, swimming, and sportball for developing gross and fine motor skills. The staff also make it a priority to teach the children (and their families) about a variety of cultures, and they take pride in celebrating the lovely diversity that we have within our city and country. And best of all, our children still \"got to be kids\".\n\nThe staff are very transparent, and are always trying to evolve the program with input from parents/caregivers.\n\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, Mrs. Lambert (director) and her staff were extremely conscientious with their infection control precautions and the safety of the children and their families; the quality of teaching and play never waivered even for a moment during this stressful time. This allowed me and my husband to continue working in the front lines of healthcare during the pandemic, for which we are ever so grateful.\n\nI only wish that the centre could continue to teach my kids beyond the kindergarten years!

        "text": "Karen and her team at Morning Glory are phenomenal. Karen has a safe space for children to play, rest, learn, grow, make friends, feel loved & nurtured.\n\nOur story of coming to Morning Glory:\nOur dayhome closed its doors end of May, I was looking for a place for my son, he just turned two. And I had driven past Morning Glory a number of times, and was intrigued. I went in and met Karen. She showed me around, inquired about my children and told me about her vision for her child care center. Upon meeting Karen I could tell that she has a gentle, loving nature & her eyes light up when she sees the children. I felt at ease in her presence. The first few weeks my son cried when I dropped him off (obviously, 🥴🥺). Morning Glory uses an APP to share photos and updates of each child personally to the parent. This was extremely helpful in easing MY comfort. Now that my son has been attending Morning Glory for 5 months, we have noticed an increase in his language skills, his confidence is up and when I drop him off he says ‘BYE MAMA’ and excitedly joins his friends! (The crying at drop off is few and far between hooray!)\n\nKaren has put together an amazing meal plan, play activities and learning. The children enjoy outside play 2 times a day (in good weather). There is an enclosed play area out back that is super fun!\nI feel supported in the growth and development of my son, but also in my own journey as a mother.\n\nIf you are touched by our story, please get in touch with Karen. I am confident you will find a home here for your child!",

These amazing women have become like family and we trust them 100% with our babies! They treat the kids like their own. I also love that my girls are exposed to a mix of cultures and language at My Daycare. The staff are so incredibly loving, accommodating and very professional. The same staff have been there for the three years we’ve been enrolled which says a lot about the management and environment. Many have been there much longer. Our daughters learn manners, social skills, hygiene, rules, kindergarten prep and have so much fun with so many creative activities! Some of the parents are teachers themselves and have raved about the learning program at My Daycare as well. I also love the outdoor space and large windows. The kids get lots of time outside in the nicer months and lots of natural light on the days the weather doesn’t allow for outdoor play.

The daycare also gives Violet socialization with other children preparing her for preschool years. Not to mention the staff who make this place as bright and wonderful for the little ones! All the social workers I've met are so great with kids and treat the parents with respect no matter your background.",

She would give me field trip forms for 3 of my children ONLY 1 day in advance and would rush me to sign and pay her. Most times asking for $60 for one field trip. My children didn't go on any field trip due to my lack of prior knowledge and insufficient time for planning and budgeting.\n\nMy children lasted 11 days in the daycare. I had enough of her verbal abuse and horrible attitude towards me and my children's step-father. I thought to myself, \"If this woman can yell in my face, give me the cold shoulder when trying to talk about issues and make me feel totally disrespected, it made me wonder how she treats my precious children?\"\n\nI give this daycare center 1 star because even the management condones their staff members behavior and attitude! If you are a parent and searching for child care, please trust your gut instinct when choosing someone to care for your babies when you can't be present. It is important and can be detrimental to their health and growth if not cautious about your child care providers.",

My daughter has been with the daycare for almost a year and as a parent I cannot express in words how great this daycare is!  From the owner to the providers and the level of care, interaction and fun provided by this Childcare centre is what I call ABOVE and BEYOND.    The care factor they show not towards just the kids but to ensure that the parents are at ease when they drop the kids is amazing.  The  programs they provide are so much fun as well as a very diiferent approach to the learning experience for kids.......my favourite is the role play.

The level of care and attention my daughter received at Precious Sprouts was unmatched and completely blew me away, and all of the staff was so easy to work with through different transitions. I always felt as though no matter the situation, there was always love and acceptance here. It honestly really felt like it gave off \"home\" vibes, and I was sad to say goodbye to this wonderful daycare when we moved. I have, and will continue to recommend this wonderful establishment to any parent looking for childcare- they are exceptional.\n\nThank you so much Daljit, Miss S and Miss K for your kindness and care, I am convinced you are all angels!!!",

The director and staff in the mountains were amazing, but the people you will deal with are the staff at progressive and they have made the experience horrific.\n\nAlthough they managed to accept our $1800 dollars immediately, their welcome package wasn't even filled out with the program name or my child's name. We were never sent a course outline, or a who to contact if things go wrong email. And boy oh boy, did they ever cause things to go wrong.\nEmails and voice mails were not returned, no one bothered to respond to confirm requested information was received.\nSomehow, despite me having repeatedly brought attention to issues with the online course access since July 2nd ( it is now August 20th) to Lisa, Charmaine, Sarah in IT, Sarah the director, the general office staff ( with no less than 20 emails and more voice-mails ) not ONCE did one person pull up his file and double checked his information . They registered hi. In the wrong class. As a  result my son spent the summer doing 80 plus hours of work he shouldn't have had to do, and an entire course he shouldn't have had access to.\n\nAll of progressives staff, from director downward have been made aware, and not one person has offered apology or explanation.\nThat should tell you about the respect they have for the students and parents they have under their care.\n\nThat have shown zero remorse, zero accountability, zero respect for the fact that despite charging me for the most expensive option, despite having multiple levels of staff aware of the issue for 6 weeks, not one person of 10 who was made aware of the problem tried to fix it, take ownership, do basic fact checking or offer even the vaguest of apologies.  They couldn't even return an email. Not once.\n\nIn fact, despite the course deadline being TOMORROW, they have not even returned a call or email to let us know how to proceed.\nMy son was supposed to do 3 units online. Instead he has done over 60. He was granted access to the 3 units 2 days ago.\n\nI am absolutely gob smacked by the lack of professionalism, by the absolute ineptitude at all levels .\n\nIf you care about your children, avoid progressive academy.  They do not seem to understand their role as educators. There is no transparency, no one to contact when there is an issue. They do not care about wasting a kids summer, or the fact we have spent 2 months trying to get a problem they set in motion solved.\n\nMy child is an extremely high achiever, attending public school, where this would never happen. This school is about as progressive or success focused as a school teaching creationism out of an Atco trailer.  All they want is your money .",

        "text": "My review specifically focuses on the current PA Pre-K program. Initially, the program was excellent - until 2021, but unfortunately, it has experienced a significant decline since then, coinciding with the appointment of Kayla as the new program director. In my experience, Kayla has demonstrated a lack of respect towards parents and has shown a tendency to label the children, which is concerning and has had a negative impact on the program.\n\nOne incident, in particular, greatly bothered me. There was a safety issue involving a child requiring emergency assistance, and instead of addressing the situation appropriately and providing feedback to parents regarding safety improvements, Kayla dismissed it as an accident. Furthermore, she displayed an aggressive and impolite attitude when discussing minor mistakes made by the children with their parents. This behavior only exacerbated the situation and left us with the impression that she enjoys creating unnecessary trouble for parents (I don't want to say, but it is very Karen.)\n\nMoreover, I have reservations about Kayla's educational background and qualifications to manage a team of highly educated teachers. While the program's teachers remain commendable, hiring an underqualified director like Kayla reflects poorly on the reputation of the PA Pre-K program and makes it less appealing to parents. We enrolled our children in the PA Pre-K program because we believed it offered more than a regular daycare program. If Kayla only has experience as a daycare provider and lacks experience working in childcare or school management teams, it raises concerns about her communication skills, experience in dealing with young children, and fair and sound approach to addressing incidents and behavior problems.\n\nDue to the negative experiences we encountered with Kayla, we made the decision to withdraw our younger child from the program. Unless there is a change in leadership and Kayla is replaced, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the PA Pre-K program to any of my friends or local community. It is my hope that the program promptly addresses these issues for the sake of its students and the community's perception of its reputation.",

They don’t listen to you they talk over you they do a lot of promises never deliver, even though they charge premium $$$ for the school. The teachers over there are highly qualified no complains about them. I have three children in there already, but the administrative part of the school is unprofessional, unhelpful, and it feels they really never on same page when you talk to them. for example, the administration staff give their own children and their friends’ children, and their relatives’ children more attention discounts extra care etc. Meanwhile, for other kids treatment is totally different, their own kids can swear, be rude, even hit the teachers, but other kids should be perfect, even tho all my kids are well respectful kids yet it feels unfair for the rest of the kids to be treated differently, I only wish the owners of the school can investigate deep into that. Administrative honestly is the worst in anything I have ever dealt with in any kind of services in anything, since these people became in it. The hypocrisy is very obvious. We pay $$$ you don’t care about little kids who might need a little bit of help but your own administrative staff not teachers have special treatment if this is not tyranny I dunno what tyranny is. Also classes been totally big so not much attention to each student as it used to be before.",

They used it for helping students in their education endeavours. They also have mixed children which was the reason I found them in the first place. My children are half Asian, my son looks full Asian. And tempo was high rated but all a bunch of white children. I felt my son would feel out of place and I didn’t like that. I love progressive for having such a race mix the children were all amazing, the field trips were so awesome.

Initially he had separation anxiety and speech issues. Jyoti, the manager was super supportive. His teachers were so patient and considerate. They worked with him and helped him to feel confident. They updated me everyday about his improvements. They were as excited as I was for his improvements, especially Nav, Sonia & Amrit. They have so much variety of fun and learning activities, field trips and sports events. Thanks to Rainbow daycare staff, I started my days peacefully knowing that my son is in good hands. I totally recommend Rainbow daycare to anyone. Thank you Rainbow team for the support and care you have shown for us.....",

Kids were eating on the floor and rolling around on the floor. If I would be a parent and I saw this, I would’ve been very disappointed.",

Other kids behaviour/reaction: As a mom, my first checkpoint is to see how other kids act in the daycare because kids don't lie. Kids are all happy, energetic and friendly in daycare. There are not much tears and sickness happened around there.\n\n2. Staff: John & Patty are awesome! They are caring, responsible and kind to all kids and I can tell kids loves them a lot. Both of them are very responsive to my questions and concern, that provides an ease of mind for me as a parent both work full time. Other staffs are great in daycare and show good care to kids.\n\n3. Environment/Meal: The area is spacious and clean for kids to have activity around the daycare during cold days, and it has an outdoor playground with sandpit (attached next to the building). I like the outdoor playground because it is NOT an extension to the parking lot/drive way, which gives me peace of mind when my boy plays outdoor. My son loves hot lunch and snack provided and that they even offer fried rice once a week.\n\n4. Extra activities during summer: John organizes weekly outdoor activities during summer and my son loves them so much (such as park visits, special events @ WEM, etc).\n\nMy boy went to other daycare before and I can see how difference he is in love with Red Apple. I hope this comment can help parent in search of daycare around Belmed area. :)",

The staff at RSOSC are professional, attentive, caring and creative. It’s very typical for my child to come home with a variety of crafts and on days when the school is closed for PD days etc. the caregivers typically plan extra fun activities and theme days such as karaoke, henna, talent shows, tie-dying, Hawaiian day, Denim day, baking and more. During these challenging times of COVID the Executive Director, Jade, has been excellent at communicating the changing guidelines and seeking parent feedback through surveys. I’m so happy we stumbled upon this location last year and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for out of school care for their child.",

It has been amazing witnessing her growth over these years and we are confident this experience will put her many steps ahead as she continues to school. We would recommend Rising Scholars to our family and friends without hesitation and plan to send our son here next year!",

We are so glad and highly thankful to Ms. Zohreen and Ms. Azia for the excellent work they have done with the kids.

        "text": "An absolutely AMAZING place! We have sent all 3 of our children to Riverbend Montessori Child Development Centre over the last 8 YEARS!! We started them at Riverbend Montessori when they were 2 and 3. The staff, the atmosphere, play areas, and other children are wonderful. If you are looking for a new place to send your children, this place is EXCELLENT. Our children learned, played, and their social skills increased so well as they grew. We loved the field trips, bike days, activities, nature walks, park days, ice cream days, birthday celebrations, sledding, Christmas concerts, celebrations of all cultural events, and many creations our children made here. We especially loved the updates and photos  we would get of our children of their activities during the day. They especially helped our last child adjust to going to Riverbend Montessori so well. He would cry when I left him, most likely because I took an extended maternity leave and he’s my baby ! (He is super attached to me). But Teacher Mylene would always be there to comfort him, and ensure he felt safe and cared for. Our family will always be forever grateful to Pam, Mylene, Mama Sana, Shazia, Susan (who have been there from day 1), and all the Riverbend Montessori staff. They treated all our children like their own family.\n\nSide comment to the lady LB who only gave a one star rating because she didn’t want to pay the administration fee to hold a spot on the wait list. This DOES NOT reflect the quality of the business and does not justify one star. It takes a lot to maintain a business (the admin, planning, scheduling etc.). When you apply to the University of Alberta you have to pay an application fee to show you are SERIOUS to attend. Many places have an administrative fee. This is no different. If 100 people asked to be put on the wait list and only 30 were serious to attend, that adds up to a lot of time and energy calling people back and confirming a spot for them. If you just want a regular “daycare” with no fee, then that’s your choice. Go find one. But I can definitely say your child will not have the same  amazing care and experiences they would have received, if they had attended Riverbend Montessori. If you are serious, the admin fee is just a stepping stone to get your child into an AMAZING program, with amazing people, and other amazing children!",

Super friendly and responsible teachers, who are always available for questions and concerns. The center looks small from outside but is actually very decent in its indoor size, with very neat and tidy sections (open concept but kids are separated by age and grouped in different sections of the room). Kids are always busy with programs and activities and are never bored or left alone. New comers are cordially welcomed and very quickly make friends because all the kids there are so welcoming and nice! I've been through 3 daycares and this is just the best one. My son had been through a bad daycare before he joined Riverbend Montessori and this daycare is just a God-sent. I would definitely recommend it to anyone around the area looking for a daycare.",

My kids definitely have their favourites!\n\nI have recommended this a daycare to everyone and anyone who will listen to me!\nI work with kids myself and this facility is by far the best we’ve dealt with as a family!\n\nSo good that I even use one of the teachers as my babysitter on the weekends and evenings when needed!!

Being in a daycare isn’t just all on daycare staff, it has a lot to do with the parent as well. Our attitude and how we deal with situations comes out in our children as we are the ones shaping their response mechanisms. Secord Childcare makes all children feel secure and wanted. We have been going here for just under two years and I would say that I feel comfortable that my kids are taken care of and loved just like their own.\n\nThe staff are nice, positive and are here to help all children grow.\n\nChildren’s emotions happen and frustration comes out of their little souls but I feel confident that the staff know how to handle the situation in a respectful and calming manner.\n\nThank you for taking care of my most precious things.",

        "text": "My daughter attended this childcare for one month. We left because she got to witness one child continuously hitting teachers. Scientific studies state that a witness to any form of violence can have the same emotional and physiological effect as being the victim themselves. This is not what our children should be subjected to. There were more excuses than solutions.\n\nFurther to this, there were a few times I walked into the room to no adult supervision this morning (and the last day of attendance) being one of those days. The teachers did not make a welcoming environment, and when this was addressed with the director, the greetings that were then expressed felt forced and more of a nuisance for the teachers than anything.\n\nMy daughter would end and start her day with a statement similar to, \"I don't want to go to the daycare.\" She is the kind of child that normally loves entering engaging and stimulating areas. Her previous childcare was a place of enjoyment and learning, along with plenty of physical activity. I do not recommend this childcare. We will be vetting childcares more thoroughly from now on. It looks nice, but looks can be deceiving.",

Your child's success in the program will be dependent on how much you're willing to commit to the homework, recitation, and weekly quiz preparation on weeknights. If your child loves learning and can work with a routine then this is the school for you. The school community is a group of people committed to their kids, and so I find that it has come along with nice families that care about success as an added bonus.",

However, on the second morning my son refused to go back, as in, he undid his seatbelt, opened the car door and ran away down the street! It was like he was fighting for his life! I realize this probably speaks more to my sweet, gentle, sensitive son's difficulty adjusting than the daycare itself. But what irked me was that when I suggested doing a few days of gradually introducing my son to the daycare with me staying there with him, the owner would have none of it. She said I was only allowed to stay 15 minutes (even though in their handbook it says parents can stay for an hour to help their kid adjust)! When questioned about that, she said \"oh that's for younger kids\". My son is 3. She also had the audacity to insinuate that he was being disobedient and that I was not disciplining him enough. I was so mad. If you work in childcare, shouldn't you be concerned about the mental health of the children more than your arbitrary rules?! So, we couldn't go back.",

Both of my children have gone to Southview.\nAs a parent , you cannot be more relieved to know that your kids are well taken care off in your absence . Staff is so knowledgeable, loving and caring . They have a very good infrastructure which includes outdoor playground and an indoor gym apart from children’s rooms which are always decorated according to the time and festival of the year like easter , thanksgiving, Christmas etc.\n\nWhat sets this daycare apart from other daycares is they always have more staff along with the permanent which are volunteering students .Extra hands means better operations. Children with different abilities are well taken care of. I can’t say enough about how amazing this place is !",

I highly rate the staff, who are friendly, kind and patient as well as the program which is open, inclusive and promotes wonderful interaction between the children.  Facilitated a gluten free diet for my eldest who has celiac disease.  There was almost no \"screen\" time which was important to me as a parent.  Staff were transparent and flexible.  The center is run by a life long caregiver that always puts the kids first.  I highly recommend to any family looking for reliable, responsible childcare.  Now that my kids have graduated from there I now really see how well they had it.  5 easy stars.\n\nSteve",

I understand that you must get out quickly but every staff had their winter jackets on. Non gave up their jackets that would fit two or more toddlers in it. Instead they attempt to handle them and wrap thin blankets on the outside. If I was a parent of these children I would immediately take them out of your care. I hope you will take this opportunity to revamp your safety drill. Consider taking them into the church beside as the rest of the school does instead of leaving them in the freezing cold.",

So, I witnessed the whole situation. I saw the staff handled the situation professionally. They waited there till the headcount was over to make sure their responsibility of every child is out of the situation. As head count would had been over, they would have proceeded to church with rest of school. Staff showed presence of mind to pick up blankets to keep kids warm. I saw two of Staff  I name them Ms. N and Ms. J provided their jackets to kids because they were on their lunch break so they had their jackets on. The owner she generally keeps three  big blankets in her car for such situations but before we could have gone to it  this situation was over and everyone went in. I am leaving the review thinking that it is not fair to  staff who were diligent on their duties. Staff prepared warm chocolate milk for kids as soon as they were in. I rate staff is very friendly and professional.I would suggest if their is any concern, please bring into the notice of Ms. S (Owner) she takes care of everything without any delay and I am sure any constructive suggestion will not be ignored.",

I love how much they care about the meals for the children. It is nutritious and it is getting adjusted to new recommendations on a regular basis. My son loves the food.\nIf there is a need of extra care (observation, documentation, care, medication for medical purposes) they do work very well with the parents through whatever the child is going through and what the child needs.\nLove this daycare a lot and we're with them since they first opened.",

He was only 14 months old when he started and i was very anxious putting him to daycare that early. But the owner, director and ALL teachers at this daycare has been working so hard to keep my son happy and safe. The cleaning standards are just top notch always. Teachers are compassionate and caring. They get kids involved in lot of learning activities throughout the day. They celebrate lot of festivals and days. Plus meals are healthy and you get to choose between veg and nonveg if you prefer one or the other. I cannot describe what a relief it is for a working mom knowing that her kid is in good hands. Thank you to all the teachers and the director and the owner for all the work you do for these kids.",

        "text": "Star Learners is a great daycare! Our kiddo has been attending since September and we are really happy with our experience so far. Most of the educators are friendly and seem quite engaged with the children. They also do many different crafts and activities like finger painting, pom pom art, circle time, and zumba. The center director is kind, caring and responsive to our questions. We also enjoy the daily updates and photos/videos that the educators send us. Our kiddo comes home clean too! No muddy shoes or dirty/missing clothes like my friends' kids at other daycares. Meals are healthy and include food from different food groups. I can tell that the staff take great care in keeping our kiddo healthy and their belongings clean.\n\nEven though our experience with Star Learners is positive, I'm only giving 4 stars because of the following: front doors aren't very secure (I suggest implementing a fob key system), we don't always get daily updates on what activities the children did, there is a language barrier with some of the educators, and since October our kid has been coming home sick quite often which makes us worried that other parents are sending their kids to daycare sick. Despite these issues, we do recommend Star Learners due to the other great experiences we have had with them. They are also clean, affordable and send updates to parents often! Their app is nice and easy to use too. I also loved the Halloween treat bag and art that my kiddo brought home recently.\n\nThanks Star Learners for all your hard work!\n\nEdit: I'm updating my review to 5 stars since Star Learners has made great efforts to address our concerns, improving our experience at the daycare.",

The staff are INCREDIBLE, some of them were with my son almost every day for his entire tenure at the center. All the educators are so loving and caring and it is evident in how much our children loved going to daycare every day and how they lit up every time they saw one of their favourite teachers (they are all favourite teachers). They take care of a child's immediate day-to-day needs, but also focus on growth, education, and happiness. Both our children thrived at STLDC, our oldest is ready for kindergarten because the educators focused on preparing him and teaching him the classroom and practical skills he needs to succeed. We have so many wonderful memories of STLDC and we would recommend the centre to anyone looking for a loving and nurturing environment for their children to grow and thrive.",

It has been an absolute joy for my daughter, and I couldn't be happier with her experience at this daycare.\n\nFirst and foremost, the director, teachers and caregivers at Summertime Daycare is exceptional. They are not only highly professional but also genuinely caring and nurturing towards the children. From the moment we enrolled our daughter, they made us feel welcome and ensured that all her needs were met. They go above and beyond to create a warm and supportive environment where the children can thrive.\n\nOne of the standout qualities of Summertime Daycare is the wide range of activities and programs they offer. Every day, my daughter is excited to go to daycare because she knows there will be something fun and engaging waiting for her. From arts and crafts to outdoor games, and educational projects, the daycare provides a well-rounded experience that keeps the children actively involved and entertained. The variety of activities helps foster creativity, physical development, and intellectual growth.\n\nMoreover, Summertime Daycare places a strong emphasis on social development and building a sense of community among the children. They encourage teamwork, cooperation, and respect, which has been instrumental in helping my daughter form strong friendships and develop important social skills.\n\nI must commend Summertime Daycare for their excellent communication and involvement with parents. They keep us well-informed about our child's daily activities, progress, and any important updates through newsletters, app, and face-to-face conversations during drop-off and pick-up times.",

I have always been very impressed with the staff (directors and teachers) as well as the impeccably clean environment. I highly recommend the daycare to all prospective parents.\n\nMy child started his tenure with Summertime at age 3 and has excelled over the almost two years since. As a child of the covid times he took some time to get acclimated to not being at home, but the team at Summertime were always very caring and patient with him to ensure his comfort without parents nearby. I feel very lucky to have the Summertime team as part of our \"village\" to help him grow. From the moment we stepped through the doors we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff, who displayed a genuine passion for working with children. The dedication and love they have for their job are evident in every interaction, creating a nurturing atmosphere that immediately put my mind at ease. I have witnessed the incredible bond my child has formed with their teachers, and it warms my heart to see the genuine love and support they receive.\n\nThe day to day activities are always changing and I really enjoy knowing that each week they focus on a new topic or idea to help expand their understanding of the world around. It's truly impressive to see how the daycare encourages each child's unique talents and interests.\n\nThe facilities at Summertime are fantastic, offering a bright and stimulating environment that fosters learning and exploration. The outdoor play area is a favorite of my child, where they get to engage in physical activities and build friendships with their peers. The classrooms are well-equipped with age-appropriate toys, books, and educational resources, providing ample opportunities for learning through play.\n\nI cannot speak highly enough of Summertime Daycare. They have created an environment that feels like a second home for my child, where they are nurtured, inspired, and encouraged to reach their full potential. I am immensely grateful for the love, care, and educational foundation that Summertime has provided to my little one. I wholeheartedly recommend this daycare to any parent looking for a place where their child can thrive, learn, and blossom.",

Unfortunately alot of the time my kids got sick.\n\nSunnyview was accommodating with catching up with paying if I fell behind. But in a year I had 1 incident i was going to be late by 10 minutes, owner insisted I needed to pay extra, and even called my wife who doesn't drive to pickup the kids.\n\nSunnview will not accept us back due to they cannot handle my children.

Every morning when he gets dressed up for this place, he no more wants to stay home but run towards the car to reach this place as fast as he can. Thats how he loves being there. He loves interacting with his friends over there, has been developing good vocabularies as well as being capable of working on his own self dependence. You get happy faces at the door to bring your kids inside. In fact, what else do you need to start your day a good one..!! Happy parent here, recommended this to a few of my friends for their kids and they are liking it too. Keep up your good work guys, great job..!!",

        "text": "Came in to this daycare in January 2019 for a tour. On this tour I was told I could leave a $50 holding fee to guarantee his spot for July and it was refundable. I'm now moving to the other side of the city so my son will not be able to go here. I called April 1st and explained to the manager and asked for my deposit back, she said sure and that she would have the owner contact me to set it up. A week and a half goes by, no call. So I contact the daycare again, and she then tells me it is actually non refundable and the money I gave was to register my son... what?? I asked multiple times for the owner to call me, the manager kept talking over me so I finally hung up. NO CALL from the owner. THEN, I wrote a review on facebook, which the owner replies that they need my number, they have it, or to call the daycare ( I have twice). She finally calls me the next day and practically calls me a liar, that there's no way her staff would misinform someone, even on an accident. If you cant see mistakes can be made on your end, I would hate to have my child in this daycare when something goes wrong. I'm so glad I found a wonderful daycare elsewhere. If you're stuck in the area, check out Skyview Daycare! They're not much further than this one, if I move back to the area I'll definitely put my son in there!",

The staff here is exceptional, providing a warm and loving atmosphere that makes you feel like family. The Montessori approach to learning has had a profound impact on my child's development - they've become more independent, curious, and confident.\n\nThe facility itself is immaculate, and safety is clearly a top priority. The diverse range of educational activities keeps the children engaged and excited about learning. Plus, the regular updates and communication with parents are greatly appreciated.\n\nI cannot express enough how thankful I am to have found Tawa Montessori Day Care.

The teachers were very patient with them, and took such great care of them. They were very accommodating of our needs, and changes when necessary. They provide a safe space for play and for learning, and encourage the children to study, to be respectful of one another and to be helpful. The girls already miss being there and we do hope to reconnect sometime. Our experience with Tawa Montessori has been nothing but an absolute pleasure.",

        "text": "This is a very special daycare. We’ve been with this daycare for over 13 years, with 3 kids that have gone through. The main thing I looked for from the beginning was cleanliness, following public health protocols, and of coarse a good fit for the kids. They have been very consistent over the years, it started out with a husband and wife that ran the daycare for over 20 years, then transitioned to the current owner Raman who has brought the daycare to a new level.\n\nThey take the time to help each child individually develop their skills and provide opportunities for concerts to see your kids shine, they also go into the community to perform for seniors at the nearby hospital and group homes.\n\nThey take the time to understand your family situations/needs and try their best to help out in the way they can. For example one of my kids would not sleep at home but would nap long at daycare, you ask them to shorten the nap and things fall into place at home…it’s appreciated. In many scenarios they have gone over and beyond to accommodate, with things that you would only expect a family member to do for you, not a business.\n\nIf you do have concerns, when you bring it to their attention they don’t delay in addressing it to completion.\n\nIt is a Montessori daycare and they use positive discipline for the kids. One of my kids after awhile it didn’t end up being a good fit because he was quite rambunctious and didn’t have the focus/interest in the Montessori pieces. Although, the staff went over and beyond to accommodate and tailor to his needs which was very touching. We ended up placing him in a more learning through play daycare that made a better fit. But my other 2 strived in this daycare as it fit their personalities and temperament much better.\n\nAll the staff are very friendly with big hearts for the kids. I like that the owner continues to support their professional development. At times you’ll see them having staff nights after hours.\n\nOverall this daycare is extraordinary! Thank you Tawa Montessori!",

This school gave me the supportive community I really needed when I entered the world of motherhood. There was so many supportive teachers and staff who helped me throughout my time there. A few times After late nights with the baby, I fell asleep on the library couch and I felt safe enough to do that there. There was a daycare on site where my son went, which made drop offs and pick ups less stressful. I made friends here and we would have sleep overs with our kids, go out to lunch with them and travel the mall together. It made being a teen mom more enjoyable and because my friends were in the same stage of life I rarely felt left out. It made a major impact in my life as a young mom, one I won’t ever forget.

An do nothing wrong but if young moms have issues adapting to life exorcism at 14 and 15 they add more areas in them with this finding. Great idea to help students but they also give student a reason to drop out and not complete school.  If students have been in the hospital or better take care of their sick children and adults we get to take the time off  work and do so without taking her children to the doctors or anything like that but now when they’re in the school the teaching them that you need to run to the doctors for every little thing that is wrong with your child from a mother of five that’s not the case I do not run to the doctors every time my child is sick but I do keep them away from other kids so they cannot get it was well as well as if you have a child was struggling with a learning disability and they need that one on one time in the computer room or whatever the case may be with a talking to counselors there they’re always marked absent which goes against the funding so then they get kicked off so once again leaving stress on a young mom for dangerous things to happen luckily my daughter has a great support team but some teen moms aren’t that lucky .

        "text": "My 5 year old was in this daycare since he was 1. The staff yells at kids and are very unprofessional when it comes to the needs of parents and children. Since the new owner, it’s been nothing but problems. My child has some behavioural issues, which started when they completely changed staff without telling any of the parents and they come up to talk to me about it right in front of my child. Clearly don’t know how to approach things and should know better than to speak like that in front of a child. They were to set out a plan to work with me about some solutions and they did absolutely nothing in regards to setting out a plan. I am the one who did all the talking while they nodding their heads. But you have bachelors degree in child care? What a joke. I spoke with licensing and they flat out told me the staff has been lying to me saying licensing would like my child removed from the facility. I would not recommend this facility at all.",

We only required emergency care but loved it so much we continued on with The Champions Academy and even commented that we should have bought a house in the same neighborhood so we would have found it sooner! It's incredible that my son STILL has friends he met while in care... We only used her services a short while, yet the impact The Champions Academy has left will be life long. They teach compassion, empathy skills, and work to offer well-informed education! Love that they were willing to accomodate our plant based and vegan needs, and their staff were always honest and worked with me to help me stay consistent in parenting! They were incredibly professional in terms of administering medicine, adhering to Covid-19 regulations, updating parents when new information was released during waves of the pandemic. Absolutely LOVED our experience!!!",

        "text": "At first, I was skeptic about this daycare even though they have reported the daily activities of my daughters with photos or video clips through their app. After going to one of the best and priciest learning academic daycares in Windermere as the best daycare for my daughters,  I found that the only difference between that center and the Mastermind was the food and cleaning of a brand new place and not the staff or their learning activity. The Mastermind experience will certainly keep me coming back. The only issue I had with them was that they kept asking me to show them the payment receipt over and over again when they hadn't saved it, which was annoying.  All daycare staff are very friendly and accommodating.  When my kids were leaving, one of my daughters' staff members had tears in her eyes because she missed my little girl. My older daughter was very shy at first, but they were able to bring her out of her shell and get her comfortable talking with other children. This is a place I recommend to my friends and others.",

        "text": "If there was a negative 5 stars I could click on I would! So my child got terminated from this daycare because they cannot handle him, a 3 1/2 year old little boy. It was suggested I get him assessed, I took him to his Doctor. A letter was written to the daycare that he was a normal little boy who did not need assessment. That was not acceptable at this daycare, I am being accused of not putting any effort into this assessment, that apparently  the manager of this daycare, (who by the way knows better than my sons pediatrician) that is not even necessary.  For the past few months this is all I heard about, assessment assessment! Try this on for size Amy, hire more incompetent workers that call me out of school because my son is having a bad day!  Who does that? What this daycare needs is structure and a lot  more experience interacting with children. I was told the staff being hired at this daycare all had teaching credentials, I am pretty sure if you were to ask any one of them to provide such paperwork, you would get the run around or absolutely nothing. The one and only daycare worker at this establishment that sees children for what they are (just children growing up) is Catherine. My son has been bitten on several occasions, he has been scratched on the face, punched in the face but not once did I hear about any of those incidents. They have a book full of incidents about my child (again being a 3 1/2 year old little boy) causing problems and hurting other kids. He was in this daycare for most of his life, spending 9 hours a day with the staff and picked up a few habits that he  should have been given a time out for, oh yeah right, Sunshine Factory has no disciplinary actions for bad behavior...NONE! So now that my child has learned some bad habits at daycare hes no longer welcome at this very daycare.",

I was so nervous about her sleep because at home she was always nursed to sleep and rocked. I made the care providers aware of this when she first started and asked how they could/would support her during sleep, and they reassured me that they would start off by holding her and slowly transition to her sleeping on the cot like the other babies (she now sleeps on the cot like the others, and naps much better at home as well). They also do so many cute, fun, and learning activities, I can't believe how much my daughter has learnt since starting in September. The ladies who work at the centre are all so friendly, we are always greeted at the door with a smile. My daughter is so excited to go and see her friends and teachers. I cannot say enough good things about this place! Highly recommend!! Thank you Tiny Hoppers for taking such great care of our daughter!",

As first-time parents, we were both somewhat anxious about leaving our child somewhere new, but the daycare laid all of that anxiety to ease as soon as we walked in the door.\n\nThe daycare itself is a clean, fun, and cheerful facility that is filled with experienced, friendly, and truly caring staff. The daycare has nice sized groups based on age which is perfect for keeping the kids engaged with others developing just like them. For us parents, the daycare is very conveniently located to our downtown workplace for easy drop off and pickup.\n\nMost importantly, our daughter absolutely loves it here. There are rotating supervised crafts and activities for all the kids every day, both indoor and outdoor when the weather is nice, which has our daughter constantly smiling. Not only are the activities great but the activities promote key learning skills and are great for learning to be around and play with other kids, too.\n\nWe think Tiny Hoppers has been amazing and definitely recommend to any parent looking for a quality center for their kiddo or kiddos!",

My little one is learning so much, and I love all the updates we get! It's very reassuring that we have a safe, happy and loving daycare to send our daughter's! Thanks everyone for all the hard work! I could see the extra effort they put to be safe and keep the kids safe during this pandemic. I appreciate their hard work, and dedication. I highly recommend Tiny Tots Daycare",

It's clear to me that there are some serious issues with how it's being run. It's not surprising that you haven't responded to other people's negative experiences either.\n\nDuring the short time I worked for you, I got to know all of the employees, but I won't mention their names because I'm concerned that they could be mistreated or threatened due to the poor management. It's my hope that you'll address these issues of unprofessionalism and the inadequate scheduling, as nobody wants a 90-minute break during an 8-hour shift.\n\nThank you again, and I hope you'll take these suggestions into consideration.",

Owner is horrible and has no patience with children who are energetic and is not willing to work with or communicate with parents like a normal adult, you don't ask a person \"what do you want\", hear the complaint out first, before interrupting midway. Learn basic customer service! and how to treat kids, at the end of the day you suppose to be competent since parent leave you with their loved ones.\n\nI don't know how they're still in business. Don't bother sending your kids or recommend this horrible place and don't spend your hard earned money. I bet there are very respectful care facilities in this area.",

The child she was picking up said he pulled his back pack.  The next day ( today April 12th) the little boys mom said for her never to address her child in that manner and if there's any issue go to contact the school and have them deal with it appropriately. The lady from the day care started yelling and arguing with the mom and continued to due so even when the bus pulled up and the kids were getting off the bus all hearing this commotion . Extremely inappropriate and unprofessional for someone who works in a day care! Definitely dont recomed. Is that how she acts in front of children at the day care?",

He learned so much and always had lots of stories to tell me. He participated in so many fun activities and field trips.

All the staff here are beyond amazing and approachable and loving to the children. The ONLY reason my son is no longer attending is because we recently moved to another city.

He came home with sand in his diapers, he attended just 3 days and we were kicked out on the 4th day. all those days, He had sand in his diapers. He was accused falsely for biting other kids, took back their words when I pressed for further inquiry. His cloths were always wet and smelled of pee even when we dropped several changes of cloths and diapers.\nWe didn't get a list of what to bring, we made up a list of what our son needed.\nThey told me he ate for those days,, but I highly doubt it. After asking in details, they admitted he didn't eat. We started packing food he loves, but these food came back untouched . they probably never offered it to him. .\nReasons for kicking him out according to them,\n\n- He is knocking things over, my 3 year old son doesn't do that\n-My wife is uncooperative because she asked to drop of bottled water for him( due to worries of lead content )\n-My wife didn't explain his autistic tendencies - this was a lie, this was one of the first info she gave.\n-My kid bites other kids ( again a big lie, they retracted when i insisted on evidences)\n-Other Kids want my kid gone ( a sweet group of 2 yrs and 3yrs old, asking my kid to leave? highly unlikely ) .\n\nMy kid was obviously traumatized and he couldn't tell us anything, we gave him days of tender loving care and I promised i will never take him to that place again. We finally found a day care that loves and accept him. He is happier and looks forward to going to the day care. He even started rattling some words.\n\nPlease be careful.",

He loved this place and as a parent, Willowbrae Childcare Academy West Point had many outstanding offerings other daycares don't offer. They have an on-sight kitchen which meant they had wholesome cooked meals which made me jealous at times, the daily reports about what they learned today with a personal note of something interesting about what happened or something your child said and everything is very transparent. The instructors are all outstanding, professional and approachable. The learning taught was outstanding with their own Willowbrae SEEDS program which you can see what they learned and will be learning. As a teacher, I appreciated seeing this. When looking at other daycares, it felt like they let the kids do whatever.  The academy sells its self when you go for a tour, you get a sense this feels like a school.\nIn June, they put on the best graduation ceremony outside when my son was ready to attend Grade K next year! I could not have asked for anything more perfect for that special day! I highly recommend this place for your child!",

Then, look up competitors and see how few violations they have by contrast.\n\nWhy can those other daycares meet basic regulatory requirements, but this one can’t?\n\nIf this were your business, wouldn’t you spend the little extra time and money obviously needed to get it running properly?\n\nI won’t go into details about my son’s injury.

From babies being pushed around on a walk in a crib all together, to not wearing hats or sunscreen on super hot days, and over feeding milk to the point of puking. Oh and not to mention a staff on her phone under a stairwell while the children were literally just sitting in the crib under the stairs and my daughter was crying, how is this programming? No one even set up our biometrics and we were able to easily go in and out of the building. Issue upon issue that is concerning. This facility is overwhelmed and does not read quality care to me. It should have been a red flag to me when the Director went on leave. Trust your mom gut ladies and choose better.",

Like most children starting daycare for the first time, her first month was a bit challenging as she had to adjust to the new environment. However, with the help of Teacher Akram and Teacher Danis, she gradually adapted and became more comfortable.\n\nOver the past three months, she has been genuinely happy here. Every day, she has had various activities to engage in, such as painting, sticker art, and doodling, among others. Unfortunately, due to our upcoming move, we have had to make the difficult decision to withdraw her from this daycare.\n\nOne thing that has stood out during her time here is the friendly and caring staff. The teachers have been warm and nurturing, which has made the transition smoother for my daughter. Additionally, having their own kitchen and providing real-time monitoring for parents has been reassuring.\n\nI would definitely recommend this daycare to my friends.",

        "text": "Things I've noticed... Which show concerns for leadership within the organization .. staff are parking directly in front of daycare causing parents to cross drivelane with children.  Turnover of facilities director and assistant director appears to have trickled down to front line, curious if this is poor pay or culture ? The new director is always in her office at beginning of day and end of day, but had yet to be observed walking the hallway and greeting the kids or parents...  I'm not sure their background, but it is a noticeable and drastic shift from the leadership which originally attracted the customers and employees to the facility... I unfortunately expect more changes as this location struggles to find it's true leader...  in addition When staff aren't consistently getting down on the kids level to speak with them it's like they've never met a kid or learned how to successfully communicate with them..  frustrating, because the facility is nice... But if you start looking at staff  behaviour and culture there's growing pains to say the least ....\n\nUpdate.. unfortunate to see that even after pointing out the obvious staff parking directly in front of the location, the Mazda CX5, Toyota Camry, and several white and silver Honda civics are still prominently parked directly in front,  even adjacent to the stroller ramp.. 22 years ago a FutureShop manager taught me that customers should never have to walk past an employee's car, it's a sign of respect... Or lack there of... For the people that allow them to be employed ..",

When they realized that my youngest responded really well to music, they'd sing to him every morning when he entered the room to help ease his anxiety and crying. That little act meant a lot to me at drop-off.\n\nThe directors are professional, very approachable, and easy to communicate with. They always have an open door, and they were accommodating too.\n\nThis was my first experience with daycare for my kids and while on the search, I'm glad I overlooked the \"bells and whistles\" that some of the other daycares have that doesn't necessarily add any value to the level of care my children would receive. Knowing that my kids were being well cared for (and more) was all the assurance I needed.\n\nLastly, I love the diversity of staff members that work here and the diversity of children and families this daycare serves. I would definitely recommend!",

For the last 5 years I worked in the OSC, during the summer they plan an amazing program for the kids which includes field trips once a week and different activities throughout the week.\n\nI had an amazing experience with them, and I highly recommend this center.

So far my baby has been in the infant room and the junior toddler (or however it's called) and she is comfortable with the ladies taking care of her in both rooms. She got used to the daycare pretty quickly with not many issues which makes me comfortable thinking that she feels well taken care there. I had high anxiety leaving my baby to be taken care by others considering that I practice attachment parenting and my baby has never slept without me nearby, but she naps at daycare better than she does at home! Overall the place is always clean, and they send photos of the daily play experience and updates on how much baby is eating, napping and how many diaper changes are performed. They also offer morning and afternoon snacks.",

Affordable price, which is $25/day with the support of federal government, unfortunately it will be end till April.\n2. Varieties of programs for kids to play and learn, in daycare and home kits as well. This is something we enjoy the most.\n3. Weemarkable App provide pictures indoor and outdoor, weekly snack menu, messages between parents and caregivers.\n4. Friendly staff, my son likes one Filipino lady Editha, she helped my son during potty training, offered some helpful information.\n5. Start from April they will offer lunch\n6. If the daycare shutdown due to Covid, they will offer credit return for the following month.\n\nCons: 1. Before you decided to join this daycare, be ready to pay full month, even you join the daycare in the middle of the month.\n2.During Covid time, they shut down the main entrance to stop parents go inside picking up kids. Just imagine when the weather is minus 30 degrees, and parents waiting outside freezing like idiots and hoping the staffs could see us and come out to open the door faster",

The staff are amazing, they are always there for the kids and never ever leave them alone in the room. They work hard to include every child in activities, take them outside to play, rain or shine, and have a social support program if you need to talk to someone. They observe every child and provide you with recommendations on how to deal with issues that arise. For example, my child was speech delayed and they provided me with materials on how to help him speak more and now he doesn't stop talking lol. He also wasn't engaging with other children and the staff incorporated his interests in the activities to catch his attention. Staff works with you figure out your child's interests so he can engage in activities. We were so lucky to get a spot here. You will never regret sending your child here.",

In fact, the whole center and staff are warm and welcoming. They follow great routines and help settle the kids into a routine that can be integrated into home life. Their Weemarkable reports are so much more detailed than any other daycare centers I have seen and take various photos of the daily activities my kid participated in. It very much helped us aware of what our kid was up to while we were busy at work, so we could still set up some routine at home for the weekends and continuously help her learn through play. The fact that we can choose to get the lunch catered is also amazing since it takes the stress away for working mom and dad while our kid tries a variety of foods.",

        "text": "I’m so happy that my son is at this daycare. My 2.5 year old has now been attending YCCC going into his 4th month. I wanted to wait a while to write a review to get the full scope of the operation.\n\nThe first month I had placed my son for the mornings only to help him adjust. I sat in with my son one day to see how all the kiddos interacted and what their day looked like. After a month he was doing so well that I left him there for nap time and picked him up right after. After a couple weeks of doing that I left him there longer. It took a while but the daycare and it’s staff allowed me to slowly integrate my son and were understanding and accommodating to both the needs of my son and I. When I pick up my son now he is happy and smiling.\n\nI also love this daycare because they have designated snack and lunch times but would always offer snacks when a child would appear to be hungry or if the child asks for one. Food and water is never restricted! I can bring all my sons favourite foods so that he actually eats. Sometimes some food comes home and sometimes all the food is gone! It’s all based on when and how much the child wants to eat. Not based on other daycares “menus” where the child may not like certain foods.\n\nAs for diaper changes, they check and change frequently. My son always leaves with a clean diaper on and has never developed a rash.\n\nThe environment of the daycare is also welcoming and accommodating. I also love the fact that it’s situated in an elementary school and not off a busy road where it’s loud or close to undesirable places. They have an enclosed  playground just for the little ones outside. The daycare also plans various activities, picnics, walks, playground visits, outdoor games ect.\n\nMy son comes home happy and I’m satisfied that he gets a day filled with lots of fun play, storytelling, arts and crafts ect. Also his speech is greatly improving from being around the other kids! All I can say is that the ladies I have interacted with and who take care of my son are all amazing. Their job can be difficult dealing with little human beings all day long but you can tell they love and care for children. I’m happy that my son attends this daycare and recommend it to anyone. Thank you!",

        "text": "My daughter has been at Youngstown daycare a month and a half now, by the third week I wanted to write a review but thought, let me wait so this isn’t written too soon. I am so happy I enrolled my daughter here! At the previous daycare my daughter was in, she was in a 2-3 year old room so I was anxious for her to be with children a couple years older at Youngstown but honestly, she’s thriving and it’s what she needed! My daughter has a speech delay so being around children that talk and interact has been beneficial. All the ladies working here are amazing, kind and have such great attitudes. They want your children to be happy, healthy and do well. The thing I’m most impressed with is that they make sure the children are fed and not hungry. An issue with the previous daycare was that my daughter was always hungry at pickup. breakfast/lunch/snacks was being provided by the facility but I would bring extra and it wouldn’t be given to my daughter. it would be very hard taking her home because she’d be throwing tantrums and starving. But here, her whole attitude is changed, I trust that she’s being fed the food I provide and she’s never in a bad mood when I come to pick up. She cried when I left in the morning for the first week, than by the second week she was walking into the daycare room by herself, going straight to her chair or to the educator for breakfast forgetting about me lol! There’s a lot of stuff they do with the children: reading, arts and crafts, games or just letting them do their own thing and play. There’s lots of variety of toys as well. They do potty training which is great! My daughter is attached to her baby doll and they’ve been working with her to break that attachment so she’s not dependent on the doll and need to bring it everywhere. I’m just so amazed. The owner is so nice and is there frequently to not just oversee the daycare but to step in and help out in whatever rooms need extra hands. I would definitely recommend this daycare!",

I am confident that when children are in care, CDDH \"offer families peace of mind\" because I see how my colleagues/staff put too much effort at their work.

We have been with this agency for 3 years and have loved every minute. His educator is dedicated, compassionate, caring and vigilant. She goes above and beyond and knows my son better than most family. We consider her part of our family. When he started there after Covid- he was on the 13th percentile for speech. We of course (like most) were on a wait list- fast forward 5 months- when his name came up for assistance they re-assessed and he was at the 87th percentile!!! Now some of that was maturity and some of it was being around people again but with 1000% certainty I can say that it was also because of the hard work of his educator. She worked hard and diligently with him on sounds and letters and now he is rocking and rolling ready for kindergarten! She was also our potty training angel! Asked us our method and how she could help!!! We have had nothing but amazing experiences with her.\nNow to the office staff-  if it weren’t for Karen helping us get subsidy and helping us navigate the government incentives we would still be paying full price! She had nothing to gain by doing so! They have been beyond flexible and the communication between agency and parents is bar none! If your looking for somewhere that will take your kids and nurture and love them as if they were their own! This is the place!!!",

The Dayhome supervisor did regular check ins at the Dayhome and with us to see if we had any concerns.\n\nWe were matched with Kawaljit - and have been so happy with the care she provides. My child was happy to go each day to her home, she was very transparent with information and shared pictures and videos throughout the day of activities and my child. There is a variety of activities which helped my child achieve his milestones. There is both independent play time as well as directed activities/reading - some of which is directed by the agency. Kawal provided ample outside time when the weather was good as well. Each day also has quiet time/nap time, as my child grew out of the nap he was still able to lay down and have some quiet time during the day. We liked that Kawal provided healthy homemade lunch everyday - we provided snacks which my child always ate. We had discussions about a healthy diet and she was very open to talking about what will work for my child as there were some food struggles we had to work on - we made it consistent at home and the Dayhome.\n\nOur child was cared for very well and looked forward to attending each day.",

My daughter was with Saima Maryam, and when my daughter started I asked her about updating the daily pictures, and activities where that is sent to the parents? And this lady had the audacity to tell me that, “with this agency we don’t do that since the parents will get upset if the see she sent me my daughters picture with the other kids”. Then I said to her to be clear as it states in the contract it says “if parents had to post it on social media or even the dayhome caregiver then they need the consent of the parents. As she starting getting aware that I read everything and I know what I’m talking about. And I pulled the contract out and even showed it to her. Then she knew she was caught as she responded saying “oh yeah we do but no parents ask for that”. Then from there she didn’t want to provide food to my daughter as she told me “my daughter was the only kid who was older as the rest of the 2 kids were only drinking milk”. Then on a day I was dropping off my daughter told me Saima Maryam scared her, and she admitted it when I brought it up to her attention but made it look like it wasn’t a big deal. After that incident about 2weeks after my daughter shares with me that Saima Maryam hit her on her hand. As soon as she told me this I never sent her back and immediately stopped her from going to her dayhome!!!! The AGENCY’S they DON’T CARE AT ALL!!! THEY ARE ALL TRASH and BAD MINDED PEOPLE!!!! I gave it 1 start bc it wouldn’t let me post this review unless I give it a start!!! THEY DESERVE NONE!!!!",

She showed me a huge binder of credentials she had obtained in this exact type of children and never felt challenged by my description. She said she knew how to manage. In effect, she knew! Tayyba was great every day we went to her. My son started speaking in no time, he was showing progress in every field, he became more organized and learned how to control his impulses. Tayyba also provided very good and nutritious home made food. Her place is always clean and organized and she has endless activities to support children development. My son is now at school full time and not going to Tayyba's Dayhome anymore, but we are still friends and he visits her time to time and have a great relationship with Tayyba's son and daughter. She is the most amazing Dayhome we have ever had experience with. 💕",

Over the weekend while awaiting the response from my last email I filled out the paperwork ready to send them in first thing Monday morning, but instead I received an email saying that there were no longer any spots for me at the dayhome. I quickly responded looking for an explanation why, with a copied message from the dayhome operator previously congratulating me for getting two spots.

My daughter constantly surprises me with new songs, skills, and dances that she's learned from her teacher. The teacher sometimes lets my daughter bring some books so she can continue enjoy reading them at home. She also makes the best snacks and meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Lastly, I really appreciate that she provides thorough feedbacks on my child daily when my husband or I pick her up or by sending us pictures of what our child did during the day.\nThe consultant visits the day home once a month to check up on the facility and program of the day home and also provides feedbacks to the parents. When the educator goes on a vacation, they find a back-up care close to your place so there is a minimal disruption.\nThere really is nothing I can complain about the educator or the agency. I'd recommend this agency to anyone I care about. Keep in mind though, that if you want to register your child, do it in advance. My daughter was in the waitlist for about 1.5 yrs?2 years?, then finally found a space only after one kid grew old enough to go to kindergarten.\n\nThanks, Southgate Medallion Family Day Homes!",
